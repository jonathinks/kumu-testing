The project has worked on mapping relevant data sources and collect available data. Data for scenario analysis for coordination of transportation and to identify inefficient logistics flows that can be made more efficient in the electrified future.The project has held broad consortium meetings in workshop format where all project participants have been involved in order, from a systems perspective, to address questions and desired results that concern more than just one or a few actors. Furthermore, a series of interviews has been conducted with employees at actors who are part of the value chain, i.a. municipal and regional authorities, network operators, energy companies, vehicle manufacturers, builders, contractors, transport companies and hauliers. A total of 9 interviews were conducted with 11 interviewees.We see an increased electrification among parties, from the sale of vehicles to the purchase and use of vehicles and machinery by hauliers and clients. City of Gothenburg has incentives for electrified construction transport and procurement of work machines specifically demanding electrification. Streamlining of construction logistics is a complex issue, but we see willingness from public actors to progress and they are inspired by each other\u00b4s initiatives. Stockholm\u00b4s work with construction/mass logistics is a forerunner, and Gothenburg has a Freight Plan under development.",

Integration with API has brought great benefits, but has also been a challenge. The knowledge of this can be spread to more actors.One conclusion is that coaching of the kitchen staff is required to maximize the effect of those techniques.First, we analyzed the prerequisites to implement the actions in commersial kitchens. We procured a consultant who had experience and commitment of the technical parts and coaching of staff.We gathered the relevant administrations and the property owner to coordinate the efforts. A municipal energy and climate advisor with solid IT-knowledge led the operational work together with the consultant with the help of the formal project manager at Energy Evolution Center.Actions took a long time due to procurement rules, the cooperation of several different actors and technical reasons.The project has focused on three large kitchens. The staff in the kitchens have been coached and trained and received information material, which has resulted in understanding and increased motivation to reduce power peaks.Integration with API has brought great gains with the effect that existing equipment can be used. To reduce power peaks over time, the measures must be implemented in the kitchen staff\u00b4s line work. The combination of visualized energy data and behavioral changes provides a long-term effect.",

The project goal is to lay out a design for an aircraft engine with three integrated air stream which is adapted to an aircraft\u00b4s thrust and cooling need in several operational points.The project is divided into three parts. In Engine Performance Model the start will be an application aircraft and associated flight mission with varying thrust need in multiple operational points. In Cooling System Requirements the need of the engines subsystems and plausible cooling needs for aircraft will be quantified. Finally, in Integrated Cooling Flow the third duct will be designed, including components for division of the air stream, diffusion and heat exchange as well as mixing of bypass flows, or alternatively exhaust through separate, possibly variable nozzles.A desired effect of the project is an improved understanding of the advantages which causes several aircraft manufacturers to present concepts for three stream engines, which will form a technical platform for participation in development of such engines in an bilateral or European context. The result will be a description of an engine concept in the form of thermodynamic performance and a simplified aerodynamic model of the two outer flows. We expect that the initial studies in this project will also make it possible to outline a wider project goal with the aim to hire a PhD student.",

The parties realized that when balancing between different desired characteristics, it is central to reduce the short term barriers. Therefore, a relatively simple solution was chosen to achieve low costs for a first smaller series. At a later stage, this will be changed to take advantage of economies of scale and optimized flight characteristics.The project was carried out according to plan in mainly three phases: 1) Drafting of requirement specifications 2) Design drafting and research 3) Workshops and engineering work. Initially work took place at Nordluft in the form of drafting requirements. This was then reconciled with RISE. Then work took place in parallel at Nordluft and RISE in the form of engineering and design sketches. Finally together in a workshop on site at Nordluft. The concept was then finalized at Nordluft after taking into account the results that emerged at the workshop, and subsequent discussions/dialogue.The result of the project was the desired one. After a good engineering collaboration between Nordluft and RISE, a clear design and manufacturing concept for Nordluft\u00b4s next generation cargo drone is now in place. This leads to fewer barriers for Nordluft to take the next step in reaching a commercial level of operations. The risk and cost of building a first batch of cargo drones has been reduced. The attractiveness of Nordluft\u00b4s concept with customers and investors has thus increased.",

The overall objective of the project is to make the road network more accessible for active travel.Identification of barriers and possible measures is done with the help of empirical data and in workshops with various actors with relevant subject knowledge based on a human behaviour perspective. With the help of a GIS-based tool, impact measurements are carried out to assess the potential for increased active transport and accessibility if the barriers are removed. Some of the proposed measures will be tested in an innovative cycling simulator that enables realistic cycling with an immersive experience.The project results in a systematic, human-centered process to identify obstacles and solutions for active transport in rural areas and their impact at the community level. In the long term, the project\u00b4s results can contribute to active travellers\u00b4 experience being taken into account in the design of the transport system.

Examples are hour price control, power control, flex-services etc. During the peak load hour, the heat pumps take as much power as 4-5 nuclear reactors produce.The goal of the project has been to improve control using self-learning algorithms. The project has shown that the thermal inertia varies greatly between different villas, and by calculating this and individually controlling based on these parameters, the flexibility capacity can be increased.About 80 res. household had equipment installed since March-23. A further 100 units are now being installed.Development of algorithms must be carried out in stages, starting with a uniform algorithm. Based on this pilot, we have been able to analyze the thermal inertia time constant, and theoretical pause time and recovery time have been developed. This will be the basis for the development of new algorithms. Several other factors will affect in practice, e.g. the dimensioning of the heating system, type, residents\u00b4 requirements for comfort and outdoor climate.The tests carried out during the last winter season have yielded a saving in energy costs of 6.7% on total consumption (approx. 10-13% for heating). During the current winter season, it is estimated that the capacity will increase by 30-50%, thanks to more efficient algorithms and where these are adapted to the heating system and the choice of the residential household. Next season, the algorithms are planned to be more individually controlled based on thermal inertia, and the savings are estimated to be 20-25% in reduced energy costs for the residential household.",

The goal is to improve operational efficiencies and sustainability in the aerospace sector by evaluating this new repair process. There is today no available method to repair these alloys and foundries are therefore often forced to scrap the components.The project involves collecting parts with surface defects, which will be repaired using DED. Various process parameters for both DED and HIP will be evaluated to identify the optimal process window. Additionally, the components will undergo different heat treatments to prevent formation of new defects (cracks). The effectiveness of the repair process will be assessed through detailed microstructural analysis. The project will include regular updates, dissemination of findings, and a final report.A successful project would lead to significant energy savings by reducing the need for remelting and lowering operational costs through minimized material waste and processing time. This supports both environmental objectives and competitiveness by promoting a more resource-efficient manufacturing process. Furthermore, this project offers significant potential for Swedish SMEs to enhance their efficiency in fabricating high-performance MAR-M-247 parts, thereby strengthening their position in the national aviation supply chain.",

Another aim has been to identify and define a number of potential and feasible solutions that contribute to the successful implementation of zero emission zone, specifically for Gamla stan (based on its unique conditions) but also for other areas.The project has been carried out based on the Design Thinking methodology and includes a business analysis and compilation of previous projects in Gamla stan, interviews and workshops with reference actors and meetings with the project group. Reference actors have been participants from different user groups who have had to describe their needs, challenges with a possible zero emission zone from their perspective and generate and evaluate ideas for more efficient freight transport. Finally, the results have been summarized in a report and presented at a conference.The project has resulted in a needs assessment and problem formulation for various user groups regarding the implementation of an zero emission zone regulation in Gamla stan. The project has also resulted in a toolbox of solutions aimed at creating incentives for transporters to switch to fossil-free transportation and/or choose alternative methods of delivery and reduce the number of transportation in Gamla stan. Among the solutions, \"super loading zone\" with mobile hub have been assessed as most promising and will be further explored and possibly tested in a pilot project.",

The goal of this preliminary study was to demonstrate the simplicity of using digital tools to create a comprehensive overview and then identify appropriate actions to save energy.We have found that influencing energy consumption often requires additional efforts beyond what is traditionally implemented in a property.In implementing a smart building or IoT functional project, the efforts for incorporating necessary integrations and introducing new data sources that do not naturally belong to any existing disciplines such as heating, ventilation, etc., are often underestimated. Even in this project, we have underestimated the time required to access existing data, as it is not always straightforward to have access to or ownership of the data. (See the attached final report \"Final Report - Smart Buildings with Digital Technology, 2022-03302\")Visibility and transparency towards users are crucial for demonstrating and providing insights into why a change in utilization levels may be necessary in the property. The functionality of the IoT portal is therefore not solely of a technical nature but rather serves as an overarching system or bridging system that can clarify the needs and impact of a specific initiative or constraint (see to the attached final report \"Final Report - Smart Buildings with Digital Technology, 2022-03302\").",

What challenges and opportunities will arise in a future where we have autonomous vehicles and robots all around us in everyday life? The goal is to create discussion, engage, and evoke emotions by allowing people to interact with an autonomous vehicle from the future.Through interviews with people of different backgrounds, genders, and ages, we will investigate how people intuitively could and would like to communicate and interact with an autonomous vehicle. Our future prototype will be the interface, the language between human and machine. At the end of the project, we will have integrated parts of this language into a vehicle\u00b4s autonomous system and then allow the public to interact with the vehicle.The project is expected to promote discussion about human interaction with vehicles and robots in future sustainable mobility systems. Insights from the project can also help both companies, municipalities, as well as developers, designers, and decision-makers to begin to understand how future autonomous solutions can become a well-functioning part of society.",

            "Description": "The goal of the project was to develop sensors that can measure moisture levels and temperature at several points in screed and deliver the data to a cloud service. This has been achieved and the sensors can also communicate with connected drying equipment from El-Bj\u00f6rn, and thus drying efforts can proactively be adapted. This has been tested in an actual construction project and made it possible to keep the energy consumption for the drying equipment to a minimum. The greatest savings in energy can be made during the cold winter months, when the load on the electricity grid is at its highest.Requirements were created by the project parties in joint workshops, and was the basis for the technology used in the sensors. Simpler prototypes of different technologies were made for verification, leading to that different technologies were tested before a technology was finally chosen. The sensor development was done with consultants with great competence in the field of electronics, a success factor when navigating between different technologies. The sensors and method of controlling drying equipment were tested in a real construction project, which was good for usability.The drying process took place mainly during October, which was a warm month without freezing temperatures this year. Despite this, the  energy consumption for the drying the screed was decreased with close to 20%. The goal was to reduce energy consumption by 40%, which we believe will be achieved if an average is taken over all months when drying efforts are needed.The construction project received valuable information that the drying of the screed was completed about 3 months before the surface layer was to be applied, and that a leak had occurred which interfered with the drying.",

It focused on detecting harmful particles that cause early EV failures, identifying knowledge gaps, and developing better particle extraction methods and analyses to prevent early damages.The aim was to explore particle extraction methods for analyzing Technical Cleanliness in batteries and electric motor components. However, it became clear that there was a significant knowledge gap regarding the effects of particles and damage mechanisms under electrified conditions. Consequently, the focus shifted to addressing these gaps before examining Technical Cleanliness methods. With project partners also interested in how electricity affects damage mechanisms, a report was created, leading to plans for larger projects focused on experimental analyses.The main outcome of this project is a comprehensive Literature Review that examines various aspects of Technical Cleanliness in electric vehicles. This document can serve as a base for larger publicly funded research projects or be used internally by the project partners to develop improved processes and routines for manufacturing durable and sustainable components and systems.",

By increasing the installation pace for Alent Dynamic, significantly more electricity savings and movement of electricity usage in the sawmill industry are enabled. Our goals were to start a cloud-based data transfer, develop a power management module and work on our new business model, and that we have fulfilled.We chose a cloud-based solution to be able to install faster. The basic requirement was that we would have access to all devices that could be relevant for energy management and that we would be able to control via soft PLC but also via regular PLC. The security issue regarding how we connect the customers to us took much longer to achieve than planned. After that, the processing of the data that we received and the work with the web interface, WMC and testing of the new software versions began and finally the evaluation of the data from the new system.The cloud-based data transfer makes installation easier. This means that Alent Dynamic can increase the installation pace and the customer gets started faster with energy-efficient timber drying and saves electricity. The power control can schedule when electricity and/or heat energy is to be used more or less during the day. Peak loads are managed by deciding in which order the various drying chambers should call for heat or use electricity. This also has positive effects in society as it affects the peak loads and relieves the daily consumption in the electricity grids.",

Also, the polarimetric configuration of the developed radars will allow high probability detection and classification of large objects as well as vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as motorcycles, cyclists, etc. in challenging traffic environment.We aim to develop gap waveguide based fully polarimetric as well has high resolution imaging automotive radars with dual linear polarized (LP) signal or dual circular polarized (CP) signals or combined linear-circular polarized signal. Hence, in this project we aim to use interference mitigation and multi-path suppression in analog domain by using CP antenna array. Also, we will exploit the full potential of the radar data in terms of its localization capability for the task of bird eye view (BEV) and 3D object detection which are arguably more relevant in automotive applications.Road accidents are one of the major causes of death even in developed countries. Innovative radar sensor sets, and vehicle perception units capable of providing accurate driving environment information in all-weather condition can play a key role here and reduce road accidents significantly. The proposed project aims to develop concrete technology enablers for future autonomous cars with improved active radar sensors at 77GHz and perception systems, which will lead towards a sustainable transportation.",

The project has succeeded in developing the One-stop-shop model, which contains a process for policy development for mobility planning, business models for sharing the excess capacity of parking in Kungsbacka as well as a program for the new development of mobility hubs and for the conversion of existing parking garages into mobility hubsDuring this project, design, finance and implementation have been combined. Users and project stakeholders have been involved early and throughout the project. Based on several workshop series, interviews, empiricism and mapping of municipalities\u00b4 mobility strategies, mobility measures and parking purchase methods as well as analyzes of these, an own model has been developed: the One Stop Shop-model.Via the One-stop-shop model, property owners and municipalities can take part in practical solutions as well as a process for finding common paths and policies for a sustainable transformation of our cities. The  model results in a significant reduction in the number of parking that needs to be built, instead the actors can use the excess capacity that exists in the first place. The model also contains a program for converting parking garages into mobility hubs in the form of packages corresponding to different levels of ambition that can be used by everyone in planning and new construction.",

There are two parallel tracks in the project: one makes use of the data to prototype a data clustering-based supervision method, the other develops a deterministic solution and makes use of the data to show reliability of the proposed solution. The positioning accuracy of the Axis and Viscando systems for real-time applications will also be evaluated.The effects, once introduced to the market (outside project time frame) is an increase in test safety, an increase in possible test scope as well as a reduced toll on supervisory personnel. The method is expected to be applicable to other areas where early adoption of AVs is possible such as parking areas, open pits, or mines however the first point of contact is the AstaZero proving ground.",

The purpose of the built-in carbon nanotubes is to use them as resistive/inductive sensors for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM).In this pilot study, experimental work will be carried out on coating carbon fiber mats from Oxeon using Grafren\u00b4s patented method. Experimental trials will then take place at the coupon and laminate level isolating the carbon nanotubes and carbon fiber veil from making electrical contact with the surrounding carbon fiber environment. Saab and KTH will collaborate in this study through their knowledge of embedding the carbon nanotubes and evaluating the sensor properties at the laminate level.The goal of the project is to, through electrical isolation of the carbon fiber environment, create conditions for SHM built into a carbon fiber structure that does not affect the mechanical properties of the basic material and that does not mix different types of materials other than those already originally found in the composite structure. The goal of SHM built into composite structures is to get better known loads during operation and as a result less conservative dimensioning, which leads to lighter structures.",

The aim of this project is to explore and demonstrate the potential benefits and challenges with using decommissioned vehicle batteries as an energy storage system connected to a charger for heavy duty electric trucks. The project aims at exploring both technological challenges and systemic economic and environmental effects, as well as logistical and financial benefits and challenges related to this solution.The partners in the project will install, operate, integrate and analyse a solution for second life use of LFP batteries as energy storage in a heavy duty truck transportation system. The full life cycle perspective of the batteries will be studied, with a holistic view of the transport system as base.The project will build on the benefits that come with the digitalization of the transport system together with the opportunities that an energy storage system provides. The ambition is to increase the efficiency of an electrified freight transport system, reduce the load on the electricity grid and create a second life for the batteries. All this will accelerate the transition to a more sustainable transport system and ensure efficient use of available resources.",

The goal is to create a dynamic and self-balancing approach where operations, parts and tools can be moved across work cells. This is accomplished by speeding up planning with software based decision support where the engineer can define partial orders for assembly and then automatically generate, verify and validate fully ordered assembly sequences and vehicle sequences.We have developed two proof-of-concept demonstrators in software, one for simulating assembly lines and one for planning assembly with partial orders. Both carried out as part of degree projects. The focus is on basic logic, not user interface. To enable a continuation of this feasibility study, we participate in EU applications with many parties, where one of the use cases is based on the work in this feasibility study. This allows us to expand the team with European partners and cover software development for a more useful prototype as well as publication of scientific articles.Expected effects are that flexibility and preparedness for changes are increased. The engineering time for planning and replanning is reduced. The planning work becomes more general and can partly be carried out further in advance and partly adjusted at very short notice when conditions change. Results from this feasibility study are: 1) Identification of critical features and limitations.2) Two minimal software-based demonstrators, delivered as part of two master\u00b4s degree projects.3) Participation in two EU applications for funding a larger project.",

It has been clarified which specific areas of use/functions are best suited for speech recognition and speech feedback. A concept study integrating a speech recognition/speech feedback system with a mining machine remotely controlled from a control room has since been performed. The value has been evaluated by having operators test the system.The project has been carried out in the following three phases:1. Knowledge gathering regarding value and area of use: Interviews with industrial design competence and analysis of speech recognition/speech feedback from industries/applications outside the mining industry2. Demonstration prototype: Development and implementation of physical demonstrator that demonstrates areas of use and technical maturity of speech recognition/speech feedback for remote control of mining machines.3.Demonstration of prototype and analysis of outcomes.The result of the concept study shows that in future operator environments there is room for several different interaction modes between machine and human. Speech has proven to be a very interesting communication medium for those cases for instance when the operator\u00b4s hands are busy with other activities. It has also been shown that certain communication commands are particularly well suited for speech communication, which will be further investigated in future development activities.",

            "Description": "Tens of millions of trips are made each year for training and competition, mostly by children and young people  and with an increasing proportion of driving parents. It is difficult to change habits, but if we can get a few percentage points more to travel together, the environment and cohesion will be a win.  The goal was a feasibility study in aim of developing business, behavioral and technical conditions around a digital service for traveling together to training and competition. The hypothesis was that there are two obstacles: A. Organizational and business. B. Behavior and habits.The study was carried out from a systems perspective, i.e. we investigated a series of perspectives and how they interact. At the center is the individual who makes the decision to travel alone or together. To understand the decision, we started with qualitative studies on the practitioners, especially young ones. A large number of factors influence travel habits (e.g. geography, type of sport), and many actors (sports managers, app companies, transport companies) may influence. Interviews with actors gave us solutions which are feasible, business-wise and organizationally.The study provides an overall picture of the complex issue. Our most important insights: 1. The technical part is not very difficult, but there is a problem around the destination, i.e. data about where to go. There is a lack of data and ownership. 2. Just as important is influencing attitudes. In everyday life, social sustainability arguments are stronger change factors than environmental arguments. As a next step, the study points to the establishment of a national register of sports facilities and a task for the Swedish Sports Confederation to promote traveling together.",

The new manufacturing process is developed with production in mind for a demonstrator part for which eligibility requirements on minimal sheet metal thinning pose special challenges.The project is based on simulation-driven process development. By simulation of the Quintus flex forming technology, it is possible to evaluate innovative concepts for forming where minimal material thinning occurs, which is crucial to the success of the project. Furthermore, evaluation and optimization are included in order to accurately develop tools and forming process that ensure successful results without risk of problems such as  thinning, wrinkling and fracture. The project includes experimental studies such as forming tests and is divided into different activities.An innovative and highly efficient manufacturing method will be developed. Through modeling and simulation, a forming process is designed that enables direct hit manufacturing of the component. The work contributes to competence development at SMEs and investigates prerequisites for production. The project involves close collaboration between, SME, researchers and the aeroengine industry regarding the production of parts to create opportunities for development, demonstrating opportunities, dialogue regarding future production and increased sustainability",

One of the goals is to identify a hot forming tool material that can withstand the process requirements imposed by high-pressure and temperature cycles while not interfering with the induction heating of the sheet. The goal is to mature the technique to TRL 4, which opens the possibility for future scaling to TRL 6 and eventual production through hot forming.The project is divided into different activities, and the project partners will contribute their respective expertise to jointly identify methods and tool materials for the hot forming process. The goal is to optimize the experimental activity and draw conclusions about the suitability of the tool material. In parallel with the experimental activities, sustainability declarations and business potential will be carried out and evaluated.Compared to conventional methods, induction heating can lead to energy savings of up to 95% through faster heating processes, increased process efficiency, and reduced heat loss. Implementing new tools for hot forming processes provides manufacturers with benefits such as reduced operating costs, environmental impact, improved productivity, and a better working environment. Increased collaboration between companies and institutes aims to seek an EU project. The involved companies can also take necessary qualification measures for approved production.",

Volvo Group is proud to deliver complete transport solutions, from vehicles suited for any task to services that keep the vehicles running efficiently. It can only be achieved by anticipating where and when a spare part will be needed and delivering that part to the correct region before this need even arises, thus reducing costs and increasing service levels. Efficient resource use in providing the right parts at the right place and time requires novel predictive logistics.Project partners are Volvo Service Market Logistics, Rejmes Transportfordon and CAISR at Halmstad University. With more data available, AI and ML methods can help to reduce climate emissions and energy consumption through more efficient use of resources in vehicle aftermarket operations. The AIM-TRUE project focuses on using novel meta-learning tools to improve the services provided by Volvo Group. We will leverage ML to understand better the factors affecting parts availability and enable individualised inventory control policies.Sustainable transport requires new ML-based, flexible, green services that reduce resource utilisation and costs while increasing customer satisfaction and maintaining a competitive advantage. Higher predictability provides opportunities for better system understanding, large-scale optimisation, quality monitoring, data-driven decisions, and more environmentally friendly transport channels. We will improve heavy-duty aftermarket sustainability by reducing three aspects: urgent transport orders, back-and-forth haulage, and part scrapping.",

Using the railway in Trelleborg as a case we tested this method over a series of three workshops to open a discussion of how dynamic adaptation can fit in the Swedish context. Additionally, we used a Windows of Opportunity approach to analyse the empirical material collected during a series of workshops to uncover any barriers and opportunities for dynamic adaptation.Three workshops were held in Trelleborg with various stakeholders. The first workshop was focused on the vulnerabilities, goals, and uncertainties of the area, while the second workshop focused on discussing various adaptation measures, and workshop 3 worked on developing an adaptation pathways map. Using a Windows of Opportunity Approach various open, closed, reframed, transformed, and half-open windows were uncovered to discuss the barriers and opportunities of dynamic adaptation.The Windows of Opportunity approach uncovered various closed, open, reframed, transformed, and half-open windows to dynamic adaptation of railways in Sweden. The results indicate that there is a potential to work with climate adaptation of railway infrastructure in a more dynamic way despite some of the barriers. DAPP can serve as a useful tool in facilitating discussions on how to work with climate adaptation in a more dynamic way on a longer time horizon than currently used in practice today.",

The goal is to understand the benefit with including energy management in the early design phase through modelling and simulation case studies and testing in the Iron Bird at the university.The project is a collaboration between Saab Aeronautics and Link\u00f6ping University. The majority of the work is done by a PhD student with support from senior researches to increase the competence in the research area. A close collaboration is guaranteed through the senior researcher\u2019s dual employment at both Saab and LiU where industrial needs are captured and results disseminated. Development of new methods to include energy management in the early design phase is done through a model-based approach. Experimental work will be done in the test rig developed in earlier projects.The trend in the defense industry is an increased need for more power and cooling to supply both sensors and effectors. It is thus important to efficiently handle large power flows to reduce heat generation, reduce weight, increase resilience, and maximize the operational capability. Both future fighter systems and existing platforms could benefit from the technology. There are also potential benefits for civil applications in terms of reduced fuel consumption and increased safety. The project looks at important topics to increase the understanding and develop design methods.",

This publicly owned company could strengthen productivity in the entire sector by a new way of thinking and at the same time remedy the backlog of maintenance.The project has been carried out with workshops, a visit to Norway, seminars but also presentations for politicians and civil servants as well as reference group meetings. The proposal for ReInfra has emerged in these talks. The result and the project are planned to be presented in a pending opinion piece, at Transportforum but also at an InfraSweden seminar.The study suggests that ReInfra AB should focus maintenance by transferring responsibility from the Swedish Transport Administration (STA) to the new company regarding reinvestments. The works should include both road and rail. The projects are to be procured by the new client organization. ReInfra shall strive to challenge outdated structures with new ways of thinking. This entails institutional competition to challenge the STA. The funding should primarily come from the state budget and amount to SEK 10 billion annually, which restores the maintenance debt.",

Moreover, the project generated valuable new steps towards alleviating the effect of a more complicated environment and complicated radar echo returns from ground clutter. The project outcome is more detailed in the below text fields on expected effects and results.The project has followed the outlined steps in the plan. First, substantial steps have been taken for more fundamental modelling of the problem (starting from the earlier NFFP7 project). This has also been guided, and supported, from an operational perspective with analyses performed at Saab. The project also intended to recruit a Ph.D. student in this area. This has proven harder than initially thought. However, the more senior researchers have performed a larger part of the project work. The output from this part also provided valuable input for the two performed master theses.The project results are in several areas. One important part of the results is the refined models for the ground clutter echo signals that have been developed and studied. This work has shown that the algorithms (from earlier NFFP7 project) can cope with more realistic models for ground clutter. This is an important result towards systems that are substantially more robust for such clutter. This has also a significant impact at project partners and helps to strengthen Saab\u2019s and Chalmers\u2019 expertise for these type of advanced radar systems.",

The Swedish team is primarily responsible for the evolution of the MaaS topology and the California team for the investigation into MaaS\u2019 potential in the US, with joint knowledge-building and -exchange activities to inform the overall work and anchor it both theoretically and empirically.  Such activities include site visits to Sweden and California; workshops organized in conjunction with each site visit and involving key stakeholders outside the project consortium, and an exchange of PhD students/postdocs.The project will generate and disseminate an updated MaaS topology incorporating the latest developments in the field, which could very well become the new standard for the mobility community. It will also report on the potential for MaaS in California (and beyond). Given this, the project will contribute to service innovation and knowledge development and exchange, as well as the promotion of partnership and collaboration between the countries and between research and practice.",

In this way, a more equalaccessibility to future mobility services can be created, which also contributes to a moreresource-efficient use of vehicles and transport infrastructure includingparking spaces.The project is carried out in three work packages. AP 1 is about planning and leading the project. AP 2 is about studying the elderly\u00b4s car use through a cluster analysis of long-term travel data from travelvu, follow-up of the use of EC2B\u00b4s services in existing projects, semi-structured interviews with seniors, housing operators, mobility providers and property developers, as well as a workshop for deepening the knowledge. AP 3 is about compiling and disseminating the results.In the short term, the project contributes to reducing parking area by 25-50% in senior housing where the knowledge is applied, and that residents are given access to safe shared mobility services. In addition to that, the residents experience an increased freedom of choice in their everyday life, an increased security in using shared mobility services. In the longer term, the effect could result in a large part of Sweden\u00b4s senior housing, which today is estimated to amount to 33,000 homes, securing safe and secure access to shared mobility services adapted for the elderly.",

The modules of a DCBS can be connected in series, in parallel, or be bypassed individually. The project will develop control and state estimation for DCBS, which will gain increased utilization, efficiency, and longevity.The project will primarily be conducted by two PhD students, one of which will be an industry PhD student employed by Scania and associated with the Division of Vehicular Systems at LiU, and the other an academic PhD student employed by and associated with the Division for Applied Electrochemistry at KTH, as well as a senior researcher at LiU Vehicular Systems devoting 25% of the time to the project.The project is expected to generate new knowledge within fields that are directly related to the vehicle\u00b4s energy consumption. The expected results are insights into how future advanced drivelines should be controlled, and knowledge regarding what kind of increase in longevity and efficiency is possible through different configurable battery designs. The project will also contribute knowledge about how battery modules can be parameterized onboard vehicles, and how models and parameters can be continually updated as a result of battery aging.",

The work focuses on identification of sources of geometrical variation, development of methods for simulation of geometrical quality and to learn more about the geometry assurance of mega casted parts.The project consists of six work packages focusing on project management, identification of sources of variation, part simulation, assembly simulation, comparison between megacasting and traditional assemblies with respect to geometry, as well as a process for geometry assurance. The project is led by Chalmers in close collaboration with Volvo Cars. The other actors, RD&T Technology and ESI Nordics, will contribute with simulations of the casting process and geometric quality for both individual components and assemblies.Megacasting means that the number of parts in a product can be significantly reduced - a megacasting can replace 70-100 sheet metal parts and thus reduce complexity. Using recycled aluminum benefits a circular value chain. A geometry assurance process to support this provides better quality and reduced costs.",

The complexity of a component makes conventional manufacturing expensive, where additive manufacturing/3D printing can be a solution. The product requires high precision and material quality after manufacturing. In this project, we used metal binder jetting for production and simulated the thermal history using Simtec Soft Sweden\u00b4s tools. The process could be adjusted to reduce costs and environmental impact By identifying deformations,.CFD simulations, encompassing a full 15-hour heating-holding-cooling cycle were conducted using Simtec software. Important processes such as fluid flow, thermal radiation, convection, and conjugate heat transfer were calculated. The computations were executed on an Intel Core i9-13900K 3.00 GHz processor with 6 threads for parallel computing. To ensure precise heat transfer, Simtec employed a dual mesh system with a separate wall mesh at the interface. The simulations utilized a total of 38.7 million cells for the fluid domain and 9.3 million cells for the wall surfaces.The study involved world-leading and comprehensive full-scale CFD simulations of the sintering process for a Metal Binder Jetting (MBJ) aero specimen inside a crucible. It took into account important factors such as gas flow, thermal radiation, convective heat transfer, and conjugate heat transfer in solids and fluids. The results provided an accurate representation of the system, with closely matched gas and solid temperatures to the experimental input. This valuable thermal history information is instrumental in optimizing and improving the sintering process for MBJ.",

Four different fabric types have been used in this study: UD basalt-based; UD flax; UD carbon; Flax/Basalt-based twill. Combining these different fabrics seven composite laminates were manufactured and tested. Tensile and bending tests were performed, and the specific stiffness and strength were measured. Hybrid laminates (UD Flax/UD basalt) showed a very promising result compared to other laminates.Suitable materials were selected, and seven composite laminates were manufactured. All plates were manufactured through vacuum infusion process with a two-component epoxy as resin. The selected materials were ordered by Gestamp and the manufacturing was done by LTU. The volume fraction was measured, and samples were prepared for testing. Tensile tests and 3-point bending tests were performed by LiU. Analytical calculations and numerical simulations are used by LTU to predict elastic properties. A comparison between the experimental and the numerical results was performed.Hybrid composite (UD flax/UD basalt) showed a good specific stiffness and specific strength which proves that more sustainable materials can be used as structural parts for the automotive industry. The results were presented as an oral presentation during one of the best European conferences, Comptest 2023 which was held in Girona between May 31- June 2.

The following main processes have been identified: customer use, return, inspection, sorting, reconditioning, and preparation for new use. The most critical processes for sustainable circular e-commerce are (1) customer use and (2) inspection. Critical factors have been developed that can assist in extending the lifespan and use of products for sustainable development.The implementation has largely followed the planned project structure where two case studies have been dominant, Parently and Idun, and extension studies have been done with other actors within circular e-commerce. During 2023, studies of literature and work at Idun were carried out. In the spring of 2024, in-depth work has been done at Parenty with a research assistant who actively participated for 4 months in the operational processes together with suppliers and customers. Furthermore, follow-ups and extension studies have been done with a total of 5 other actors.The project has explored and contributed to knowledge in reconditioning for sustainable e-commerce. Knowledge has primarily been implemented at the participating case companies but also disseminated through seminars and workshops. A conference publication and a forthcoming journal publication have been generated presenting a framework for sustainable reconditioning for consumer products. A central area for continued development is the scalability of circular concepts. New projects have been initiated with a larger consortium for continued innovation and research.",

This pilot shows that this technology has the potential to make Scania\u00b4s transportation more efficient and thereby reduce Scania\u00b4s environmental impact.Battery-free radio units are mounted on boxes that send an encrypted ID and information about environmental changes in the shipment. Bridges are installed at entrances where goods are handed over. Bessa sends data to the cloud via a 4G or 5G network connection. The key technology is the two cloud systems: the Wiliot cloud for tag ID decoding, which then sends data to the Gravity cloud by InnoTractor which also receives data from the bridges and from the radio units and combines this into useful information presented in the Gravity dashboard and Wiliot -the tag ID decoding cloud.The pilot showed that it was easy to set up the system and that there is good potential to streamline the flow, including through more efficient deviation management and reduced manual work. The technology worked without deviations and Scania could follow all transportation in real time and receive the desired reports",

The focus is on different capacities in the use of new mobility solutions, new forms of accessibility and other more digital solutions. The project challenges notions of mobility and prevailing planning norms in society that are based on mobility and centralization of basic destinations in daily life.\"All aboard\" makes use of knowledge and experience from pilots andimplementation of new solutions (mobility- and service solutions). Research shows that many innovative initiatives are underway, but that there is a lack of knowledge compilation and follow-up. The basis lies in collaboration and dialogues, and includes users, non-users and other key stakeholders. \"All aboard\" intends to involve social movements and senior activists to challenge norms and habitual behaviors, thus co-creating more sustainable future scenarios.With a participatory approach, \"All aboard\" contributes to new and deeper knowledge of various conditions for changing consumer- and travel behaviors through new solutions and digitalisation. The results form the basis for  policy proposals for future social development, that promote socially sustainable societies, with increasing conditions for a good quality of life and health.

The date for this is April 5, and the dissertation with included articles will be ready for pre-review in mid-February. Completion of the thesis also involves a documentation of the code, which was an additional goal for the project. In terms of technical work, functionality such as calculation of characteristic modes has been implemented, and we have identified the additional algorithms that can be implemented in the near future.The continuation project has proceeded according to plan. It has essentially been carried out on site in Lund, and has been dominated by writing the thesis and documenting the code, but also some experimental work and theory development. Regular meetings with Saab have taken place online.The completion of scientific articles for the thesis has further verified and developed the code in several aspects, including comparisons with measurement data and implementation of a method for calculating characteristic modes in an international collaboration. Discussions have begun with Saab about parallelization of the code, and are expected to continue in the spring of 2024.",

The draft includes descriptions of five demonstrators, including associated budget estimates. The project description will be supplemented and further anchored with project partners and finally submitted to Accelerera\u00b4s call for system demonstrators during fall 2024. The project proposal has established and connected many partners and stakeholders.The proposed solutions have been selected based on their level of innovation and TRL as well as their potential to change the travel behavior of visitors to events. For each demonstrator, one or more hosts have been identified. For EVS38, it has been difficult to anchor the demonstrators with the organizer before April 24. Several of the identified hosts would like to demonstrate during EVS38. Demonstrations will also be conducted at other events during the project period. More time and additional demonstration opportunities provide better chances for evaluation.Solutions with the potential to reduce climate emissions from travel are demonstrated at various events/destinations. Most of the solutions focus on individual behavior. The project combines solutions with communication and persuasion strategies. One demonstrator, the Toolkit, has a broader scope than transport and is aimed directly at event organizers, helping them to identify solutions during planning and follow-up. Stakeholders have shown great interest in the Toolkit, which they claim can be very helpful in the long run and potentially provide competitive advantage.",

Both ICAS program committee and Swedish organizers invited special keynote lectures as well as full sessions with the intention of raising technical quality. The ICAS program committee evaluated all approximately 850 received abstracts and selected the best for presentation. A large number of national and international companies/organizations were invited to exhibit products or support the congress financially. The focus was also placed on getting many students involved.The congress gathered some 1000 participants, which is a new record for ICAS, and has received very good evaluation from the participants regarding both technical programme, the congress arrangements and the social program. This gives a good impression of Swedish collective activity and competence in aviation technology.An overall technical result is agreement on that access to green energy is necessary to solve aviation\u00b4s sustainability issues. The two solutions that completely dominate are green hydrogen or SAF (sustainable aviation fuels).",

This includes developing techniques for planning and simulation of a reconnaissance mission with three drones that carry out a joint ISR mission. The capability has been realized using open-source software and simulated and evaluated in two separate environments. In the first, extensive simulations and evaluations have been done and in the second we have demonstrated the possibility of integrating this capability in a system-of-system context.Focus has been on problem definition, planning/execution and evaluation of a collaborative search capability. As problem definition, a scenario has been defined. Which is realized by three drones that iteratively, search terrain areas via joint, continuous re-planning, triggered by the acquisition of new information about the area. Evaluation has been done through simulations to identify the impact of different scenario configurations on the effectiveness of the search capability. The possibility of integrating this capability with external systems has also been explored.The result shows how to develop a cost-effective and efficient drone swarm-based reconnaissance capability by exploiting the potential of open-source software and AI-based planning algorithms. The capability has been evaluated in two environments. Focus in the first environment has been to perform extensive simulations to identify the impact of different scenario configurations on the effectiveness of the search capability. In the other environment, focus has instead been on demonstrating the possibility of integrating the capability in a system-of-system context.",

The digitally powered networked solution will contribute to the overall digitalization of the maritime industry making supply chains more efficient.The project builds on RISE relationships with leading Swedish shippers, and with Singapore as one of the world\u2019s largest transport nodes through which Sweden\u2019s cargoes pass. Under the leadership of RISE and A*Star/IHPC in Singapore the VWT concept will be prototyped in a real-life environment. The project engages various actors, sometimes the largest in their segment, in different and sometimes multiple roles to respond specifically to shippers\u2019 needs. The innovative process will be driven by Living Lab meetings, user-centric workshops, and continuous knowledge sharing.The pilot aims at improving situational awareness along maritime corridors and collaborative behaviors and practices for better supply chain management. This will benefit the maritime industry through cost savings and delivery accuracy but also Swedish importers and exporters through competitive edge, higher customer satisfaction through less delays and costs. The VWT is deemed to be used beyond the duration of the project to serve an ever-growing VWT community.",

The user study will also investigate the gender differences in the acceptance and effectiveness of driver monitoring and ADAS. We will determine how to deal with these differences and investigate how they affect the safety levels of the driver support systems to improve the acceptance and effectiveness levels of the provided driving support systems in a gender-adjusted way.Current driving experimental simulations of driver monitoring systems and ADAS will be usedto determine the cognitive predictive limitations that need to be supported to increase more reliable interaction with ADAS and increase road safety. Traffic situations, time frames, driver characteristics (e.g., age, gender, mood, driving style), reaction time and crash avoidance are variables to be used. The result is to propose further development of driver monitoring and driver support functions to design more individually adaptable driver support systems.",

Through a state-of-the-art study, interviews with stakeholders, and a detailed site assessment of the chosen route, this pre-study has answered this question and prepared for a continuing pilot study.We have conducted an extensive site assessment for the chosen route between Arlandastad and Arlanda Airport. Along this route, there are two designated bus stops strategically located to serve passengers. The speed limits on this route vary, ranging between 50 to 70 kilometers per hour. Notably, the route experiences low traffic, providing favorable conditions for autonomous bus operations.Needs: Travel options on the route are limited today and do not meet the actual demand. Autonomous buses offer a sustainable option to address this growing demandTechnology: The vehicles we aim to use for a pilot are designed for public transport purposes and it has been identified that the existing infrastructure on the chosen route will need some modifications and mitigations to facilitate the operations.Business models: The bus operator\u00b4s business model needs to shift to becoming more dynamic and the project has identified two potential paying customers to establish a revenue base.",

The project is implemented via three main activities: 1)The toolbox  a service developed for event organizers of events to support climate-smart planning. 2)An innovation lab where experts from different fields cooperate to develop novel solutions.3)Trials and evaluations via real events.Events are temporary occurrences that are not part of visitors\u2019 daily routines, which enhances the possibility to bring about behavioral changes. Trialing and testing climate smart innovations in an event setting explores this possibility and also creates visibility for novel, low emissions solutions. In addition to these aims, the project seeks to create spinoff effects in that transport-related innovations developed within the project can be implemented in Swedish cities, municipalities, regions and possibly also on a global market.",

            "Description": "The purpose of the project has been to find a way to relieve the power grids at high load by using hourly price control of electricity-based heat loads. The goals of the project were several:* To develop a module to retrieve hourly prices* To implement, test and validate the control in four housing cooperatives* To evaluate the results both energy-technically and economically.All these objectives and goals have been met during and through the project.The plan was to first develop a module to collect hourly prices from the electricity exchange and then enter it into the heating control. Algorithms were then developed to be able to prioritize which heat source(s) should be used based on cost, as well as algorithms for error handling. The control was implemented and then tested in four BRF and evaluated technically and economically after about 6 months of operation. During the process, a number of potential development areas have also come up that will lead to follow-on projects.The project was expected to lead to a functioning control to be able to automatically prioritize heating with a heat pump and/or district heating based on what is currently the most economically advantageous. It was also expected to lead to functionality that can disconnect the control in the event of a failure. A further expectation was to be able to obtain a decision-making basis on whether it might be profitable to switch to hourly metering and billing of electricity for a condominium association instead of a fixed or monthly variable price agreement. These expectations have been met.",

Bill of quantities and other documents for RFT have been developed, barriers have been mapped and differences in climate impact and costs between the solutions have been studied. The project\u00b4s objective has thus been fulfilled.The project was carried out in the following activities:- Development of description of alternative solution- Design of alternative, fictitious, documentation for request for tender (RFT)- Comparative cost and climate analysis- Reference group meetings- Synthesis and report writing- Project management and coordinationThe study shows that the biggest barrier for building the wooden solution is the client\u00b4s requirements on design for very heavy maintenance vehicles. However, the wooden solution is designed for lighter maintenance vehicles. An adaptation of requirements is therefore needed.The cost and climate analysis shows that the wooden solution is more expensive than the traditional one but has significantly lower emissions of greenhouse gases and can be climate neutral if carbon sinks in wood is included. With climate bonus in the contract, it could then also be cost-neutral.",

            "Description": "The goal of the project is to create stable, reliable and verified concepts for mechanical joining processes of die-cast aluminium components. This will improve and enable an increased usage of cast aluminium materials. The project will thereby contribute to increasing circular material flow, enabling of circular manufacturing, prolonged lifetime of products and parts, and create the premises for robust production with cast aluminium parts. The project aims tofacilitate the assembly and introduction of these materials and improve quality of joining of these materials.The duration of the project is 29 months. The project is organized in 5 work packages. Experimental studies of established joining methods like self-pierce riveting (SPR), clinching and flow drill fastening (FDF) will be conducted and accompanied by comprehensive material characterization, exploration of numerical methods,and investigations on disassembly possibilities. The project results will be disseminated within the project group and at national and international conferences.The collaboration within this project will distribute and implement the created knowledge along the whole supply chain and will lead to better understanding for design and production of cast parts as well as strengthen the knowledge towards cast materials which provide substantially different requirements for joining. Being able to join low ductile alloys will increase the usage of recycled aluminium alloys in future and increase circularity in the material usage for structural components in car manufacturing. For mega castings this increased circularity will be substantial.",

The project has developed a technical specification on what data are needed to be able to realize a triangulation application and which actors that need to cooperate. As a basis for the technical specification, the following dimensions of system innovation have been evaluated: technology, products and processes, business models, infrastructure, policy and regulations, as well as company behavior, culture, and values.The project was conducted in the form of a qualitative study where interviews and study visits comprised the primary data collection. The data originate from site visits to inland terminals and interviews with shipping companies and forwarder and haulage companies.Four types of triangulation have been identified; i) street-turn via port, ii) street-turn via inland terminal, iii) depot turning, and iv) regional triangulation. Nine actor types have been identified as important, which means that these either have a great interest and would benefit greatly from realizing triangulation or that they possess some information that facilitates triangulation. The project has mapped the data needed to be able to realize a triangulation application in the form of a technical specification and which actor that possesses these data.",

Successful results have been achieved and the project has also produced a new sensor for temperature feedback that can measure at high speed and at low cost compared to e.g. IR cameras, while being robust and easy to integrate with existing vision systems and optical elements.The project has been carried out at Production Technology Centre in Trollh\u00e4ttan in an industrially relevant environment using production-like AM equipment, which has been a key factor for the project\u00b4s success. The project was divided into five different work packages: 1. Mapping and procurement of hardware. 2. Integration of hardware and development of vision algorithms. 3. Development of closed-loop controller. 4. Validation of the control system\u00b4s performance, robustness and repeatability. 5. Dissemination of project results through workshops with potential customers.Thin-walled structures form a significant part of the total capability that must exist for AM to be used on a large scale in the aerospace industry. The successful project results enable new applications for AM in metal which is an important step towards increased electrification of metal production, less waste and greater design freedom. Through increased design freedom, components can be made lighter and stronger, which can result in more energy-efficient machines. More local processing also becomes possible, which strengthens national production and reduces transportation.",

Building permission was granted in February 2023 and procurement of greenhouses and contractors followed. During the autumn, the greenhouse was built and it was ready in November. Various installations remain. When the facility is in operation, it will be managed by G\u00f6teborgs Stad and leased to local growers. Administration, construction and procurement took considerably more time than estimated. It looks like it will be a really good facility to test heat recovery and cultivation techniques.The facility enables local production of vegetables most of the year, different cultivation techniques is tested. Growing in natural light, generated by the greenhouse, greatly reduces the need for artificial light (LED). Electricity savings are made compared to growing in 100% LED lighting. In order to be able to grow most of the year in a low-insulated greenhouse, heating is required, using residual heat from the Data Centre. We test and develop business models for urban growers.The facility is expected to be in operation from January 2024 when cultivation and measurements can begin.",

It sought to investigate how hydrogen is influenced by sector connections and to map the requirements for a potential phase 2. The submitted report includes a comprehensive background, a model with calculations of the value of sector connections, and recommendations for framing phase 2 in the form of a project with three areas.The project was performed with a student team and a coordination team, presenting individual reports, and a partner group who participated by providing experience and technical information. The research coordination team was responsible for communicating with all parts of the project and as supervisors for the student group. The partner group consisted of representatives from Ovako, Hitachi Energy, and Volvo Trucks. The research was conducted through literature review and technical data from the partner group, and the development of models of the system of the facility.As a result, it is clearly shown that sector connections, the flexible solution with fossil backup, and the added value from the self-use of oxygen provide significantly improved economic conditions for similar projects. A project structure for further studies is proposed, including aspects related to the possibility of establishing a system demonstrator. The expected impact without phase 2 is limited since the result is primarily background and a concept for a future system demonstrator.",

A total of three software tools have been tested and made available to the public via the digital experimental laboratory \"SED Lab\" which is under development at Chalmers.The project has been characterized by close collaboration between academia and industry. Weekly meetings, workshops, and visits by the PhD student to GKN were conducted. In addition to team activities, students working on the two bachelor\u2019s theses within the project had the opportunity to visit GKN. Other key activities include the installation of MDAC (software) in GKN\u00b4s IT environment and the dissemination of results at an Aerospace conference (ISABE 2024).The primary goal was \"to validate what was developed in the DIFAM project in an industrial environment and to scientifically publish the results\". The methods have been further developed and tested in an industrial environment by having the tool installed internally at GKN. This possibility is critical as sensitive information must not leave the company. GKN benefits directly from the results, which also benefit engineering companies outside the aerospace industry through the SED Lab at Chalmers and scientific articles.",

Since many challenges are interdisciplinary in their nature and advancements in one discipline are often hindered by obstacles in other disciplines, this report is intended to give a broad overview and general understanding of as many AV related aspects as possible and to make interdependencies between different areas visible.The report starts with an AD market overview (Chapter 3) that explains the underlying market dynamics and explores the diverse use cases and roles played by different actors along the value chain. Chapter 4 gives an overview of the different parts of the AD ecosystem. For those parts of the ecosystem as well as additional stakeholders, chapter 5 addresses critical challenges contributing to the delayed roll-out of AVs. Potential solutions are outlined alongside an effect analysis. Chapter 6 concludes with tailored recommendations.Based on the authors\u2019 experience of developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the surrounding on-demand mobility service at NEVS and numerous discussions with industry experts, the main reasons for the delayed roll-out are:Firstly, the overall complexity of the problem and the many interdependencies between different and often otherwise unrelated disciplines.Secondly, the fact that there\u2019s no purpose-built AV available today that has both a design optimized for ridesharing and the technical maturity for AD technology to unfold its full potential.",

It shows what is required to create sufficiently favorable conditions for a range of key actors to contribute to electrification and thus create a sustainable business ecosystem.The analysis is based on four data types: 1) workshop with those that are affected and can contribute to the electrification of transportation, in particular of S\u00f6derenergi\u00b4s transports; 2) Interviews with key persons connected to S\u00f6derenergi\u00b4s electrification investment or who may have a significant role in the long run; 3) observations of S\u00f6derenergi\u00b4s facilities (the railway terminal in Nykvarn and Igelstaverket) with focus on current logistic arrangements and possible charging points; 4) reports and research material regarding the electrification of heavy road transport.We expect that the results from this study can be the basis for planning and decisions regarding business models linked to enabling the electrification of the studied transport, as well as other similar transports. The most important contribution to support practical implementation is a broad view of how different business models are connected and how to ensure that each key role becomes attractive enough for an actor to shoulder it, so that this role does not become a bottleneck that holds back growth of a new functioning business ecosystem.",

The project\u2019s fulfilled objective was to collect naturalistic e-scooter riding data and to address three research questions: 1) Can the data loggers provide sufficient data to support crash reconstruction?, 2) Can we identify unsafe riding behaviour based on accelerometer, gyroscope, and GNSS data only?, and 3) Can we use the collected data to model road user interactions?The work was done in three steps. First, data from shared e-scooters was gathered. Second, automatic data processing and augmentation together with data exploration tools were set up. Third, Processing algorithms were developed to 1) detect safety-critical events, 2) detect hand placement on handlebar, 3) road surface roughness estimation, and 4) detect, track, and estimation relative position of other road users. The research questions were addressed by combining and interpreted the processed data.This project has collected naturalistic e-scooter riding data. The analyses of the 2315 trips gave preliminary answers to the project\u00b4s three research questions. It was shown that the data could provide valuable information for crash reconstruction. Some unsafe behaviours could be automatically detected. Some aspect of the interaction between pedestrians and e-scooter riders was modelled. The identified limitations of the project, and the promising results open the door for extended research to improve traffic safety.",

The objective of this project is to investigate the improvement potential and applicability of new technology for quality measurement in the drilling process. This has been fulfilled through a proof of value study where the technology is partially integrated into today\u00b4s work process.The project was carried out in three phases: 1. Knowledge gathering regarding value and area of use; This phase consisted of interviews, workshops, analysis of today\u00b4s solutions and shortcomings as well as a shorter concept study of the potential for improvement.2. Demonstration prototype; This phase consisted of the creation of a physical demonstrator that demonstrates the applicability of key features that improve quality monitoring in the drill and blast process.3. Reporting of results and description of continued need for technology and method development.The project started with a knowledge gathering phase, assessing the value which hole quality measurement can add to the mining process. The value is found to be large for those cases where you have recurring problems with the blasting result, usually due to inappropriate rock size distribution. In the project, Epiroc performed tests together with a technology supplier to evaluate available technology for hole deviation measurement. A number of adaptation needs have been identified and a demonstration prototype has been produced which has also been tested in Epiroc\u00b4s test mine.",

The project\u00b4s sub-goal was a collaboration platform for implementation, documented use cases with an overall description of technical, business and user considerations and proposal for funding for implementation.The project did not get together a constellation to implement a pilot with, but many lessons learned.The project was planned based on a concrete implementation of knowledge acquisition, conceptualization and feedback from residents, companies and researchers. Unfortunately, the project got stuck in the existing actor roles and power structures, and underestimated the prevailing actor politics. One lesson learned is that the project should have made more room among the societal actors before implementation to avoid this. It could be done by working on several political levels in parallel, so as not to get caught up in the influence of individuals.The project brought together actors who normally compete, and increased knowledge about level 4 autonomy in different formats and its importance for urban planning and public transport. The lessons learned about the difficulty of getting different societal actors on board can facilitate future work with system change. The current missions of the societal actors, the need for goal alignment and the need to increase understanding of the impact of autonomous vehicles on a sustainable mobility systems are the obstacles that have been identified and still need to be changed or overcome.",

An important foundation in this work is a developed and applicable decision support tool that can estimate charging needs and suitability with high geographic resolution on a national scale. The long-term goal is for the results to assist relevant actors nationally in the planning and construction of an efficient and fair public charging infrastructure in cities.The project will be implemented in seven work packages (WPs). WP 1-2 is related to the development of the decision support tool and WP 3-6 are qualitative WPs with aim of partly creating new knowledge but also assisting with qualitative results to improve assumptions and variables in the decision support tool. The project will be carried out iteratively between WP and project participants. WP7 is responsible for coordination and dissemination of results, where ongoing contacts and dissemination of results with both private and public stakeholders is a high priority.The project\u00b4s results have potential to increase knowledge and influence decisions for the future expansion of public charging infrastructure. The public charging infrastructure is already today a critical factor for the choice and use of rechargeable vehicles, but the importance will only increase as the proportion of users without their own parking and thus without access to their own charger increases. The project\u00b4s developed decision support tool are expected to be used by both private and public actors to prioritise the future expansion of public home charging.",

Potential neck injuries in car accidents ranges from fractures and dislocations in high-severity crashes to the more frequent soft tissue injuries, often called whiplash injuries. The overall goal is an advanced tool for the development and assessment of passenger protection of future automated vehicles.The project develops and integrates a detailed cervical spine model with associated methodology for injury prediction. The model will mainly be improved with regard to the anatomy of the cervical spine and biofidelity, injury risk prediction measures for different injury types, simulation robustness for a large number of crash situations and passenger seating positions, as well as refined scaling methodology for the diversity perspective. The basis for the improvements will be from scientific publications and transferred into simulation models.An enhanced cervical spine for the SAFER HBM and associated injury prediction functions at tissue level are central in modelling the response of an occupant in regular upright sitting posture, as well as for future seating variations and occupant kinematics in automated vehicles. It contributes to SAFER HBM becoming an established global tool, which helps the Swedish partners to strengthen their leading positions in vehicle safety. Furthermore, these improvements serve to make the SAFER HBM a preferred tool for Virtual Testing consumer information protocols around the world.",

The long-term goal of the project has been to contribute to more sustainable planning with a focus on improved climate adaptation of transport infrastructure in and around cities, as well as to lay the foundation for a possible continued research and innovation project.The project has consisted of 3 main parts. 1) A literature overview with about nature-based solutions for climate adaptation of cities and transport systems. 2) a case study together with Trelleborgs municipality in which workshops and testing and evulation of the planning tool have been carried out. 3) A reference group consisting of Bor\u00e5s stad, Botkyrka municipality, the Swedish Transport Administration and the County Board in Sk\u00e5ne L\u00e4n has been introduced to and reflected on the SUNRA municipality and its potential value in climate adaptation planning.The main conclusion from the project is that, despite interest in a tool for climate adaptation of transport infrastructure, it has been difficult to find a clear process for implementing the SUNRA tool in existing planning processes that are surrounded by strong legal requirements and institutionalized processes for managing climate effects in planning. Development potential for the tool is assessed to be 1) a project where the tool is applied in a clearly defined project and 2) 1) a further development of the tool to increase its usability.",

The goal of the investment was to put the product into production, carry out a rigorous beta test in student apartments, demonstrate energy savings and then offer the product to the market.The goal has been fulfilled in that the product has now been tested and proven to work as intended, can be produced and is available to offer the market via our websiteWe had a good plan for our project but suffered from various delays that had to do with the casting tool being manufactured in China and the delivery times were longer than we had estimated. We also needed to cast a test run to ensure the tooling worked as intended and that added extra time to the schedule. The delays meant that the installation was only done in June and that was probably a good thing because many of the student apartments were already empty by the end of the term and that made the installation considerably easier.The result was an energy saving of 10.95% during the period June to November. The energy savings are expected to be even higher over a twelve-month period, considering that the energy savings are greater when it is cold outside.",

The tools assess energy and power performance, identify maintenance actions, and evaluate the implementation. A steering signal for heat pumps was developed for participation in the SvK\u2019s frequency reserve market.Data from SvB was linked with Oden. Typical energy-saving measures were provided with automated estimations of energy savings.A test property was selected for integration in preparation for participation in the mFRR market. The property\u00b4s thermal inertia was identified for each hour of the year, and the characteristics and heating curves of the heat pumps were mapped out to develop a flexibility forecast that collects data for historical and upcoming indoor and outdoor temperatures, as well as light ingress. Systems were prepared for pre-qualification to SvK\u00b4s mFRR market.The developed digital toolbox allows for structured energy renovations at SvB, enabling new internal processes for energy efficiency and maintenance planning. Further accumulation of energy data would not only allow for better evaluation of rolled out projects but also enhance the quality of prediction of the effects for the planned measures. The test with heat pump flexibility will further expands SvB\u2019s opportunities of investments and revenues in its building portfolio.",

If successful, the feasibility study will create the foundation for an implementation and scale-up project that will support Northvolt and RISE to take EV battery production technology to a higher level of sustainability and affordability - for the benefit of the global environment.The pre-study project is performed in seven subsequent work packages. Both Northvolt and RISE will be involved in all work packages and they will conduct the work in close collaboration. The core activities will be conducted by Northvolt whilst RISE will provide key contributions concerning existing solutions and challenges, limitations, and requirements, for the potential microwave and inductive drying process. Each work package is divided into multiple tasks. These, together with a series of project milestones, will provide the key to success for reaching the project goals.The pre-study will investigate sustainable and cost-efficient processes, based on microwave and inductive curing and drying methods, for EV battery electrode manufacture lifting the maturity to TRL 3. This will provide the foundation for an implementation phase project for the new production process technology. The pre-study will also analyse the production process method to have a minimum environmental impact with a life cycle perspective. Furthermore, an economic model will be developed and implemented at the Northvolt facilities for the new production process technology.",

To cope with this, cooperation is required across the entire sector, which is why we would like to see other actors participate and contribute to the work. The customer network has been established for a year and a half, through previous project. The goal of this project is to continue running the network for another six months.The work is carried out in two main forms of work. Innovation teams are a number of smaller groupings that drive development within 3-5 important development areas for the network. We currently have three innovation teams: Common requirements in procurement documents, Knowledge of good material selection in construction projects and Customer network as a working method. The other form of work is network meetings where the entire network is seen. On these occasions, results are disseminated and knowledge input is given on common challenges.Expected results from this study are to establish long-term funding so that the Ordering Network can continue on its own. The ambition is that the results from the client network should not only contribute to increased client competence and a greater understanding of different and common needs. In the long term, a greater collective client competence and purchasing power is also expected to result in clear environmental effects, not least concerning the sector\u00b4s emissions of greenhouse gases.",

A project group, consisting of the doctoral students, their supervisors, and specialists at the company, meets 3-4 times a year to be updated on the project\u00b4s progress and to discuss both specific research questions and general continued directions. Scientific publications become an important part of presenting results. The time frame is 2023-2026.Transportation has today begun to be seen as a service instead of a product: \"Transport as a Service\" (TaaS) and at the same time there is development towards the electrification of the truck fleet. For TaaS to be sustainable, the vehicle fleet and its tasks must be managed effectively. The context will differ between customers, logistics partners involved and the type of goods. Expected results are business models for TaaS and future transport with efficient resource utilization. A minimum of stationary vehicles and maximum capacity utilization are examples of good efficiency.",

We aim to repurpose state-of-the-art models for object detection as well as depth estimation. The models will eventually be integrated into a system and deployed to hardware for real-time testing on the target vehicle types (e-scooter and e-bike). Finally, the functionality of the system will be demonstrated in a lab environment.A collected object detection dataset will be shared together with model weights for an image classifier. We believe that the sharing of research artifacts will promote further research into safety and sustainability of small electric vehicles. Our findings will be documented in a scientific paper. In addition, we aim to publish any novelties related to depth estimation in a separate scientific paper, to promote further research.",

Solar cells could be used to partially power trucks and in this project we will test a truck with solar cells for a longer period of time in operation in real missions to get closer to a commercial solution. In the project, we will also focus on implementing the truck from a user perspective, and develop solutions that provide a more efficient and production-friendly truck. The overall goal is to achieve more environmentally friendly truck transports.The project lasts for two years, and we have divided the project into work packages (APs) for the different parts of the project and who will do what and when this will be done; AP1 project management, AP2 test of systems in operation, AP3 solar energy from the truck in a larger system, AP4 development of solar cells for trucks, AP5 business logic, policy and regulations, AP6 dissemination of results. The project includes research (Uppsala Universitet), vehicle manufacturer (Scania), solar cell manufacturer (Midsummer), transport development (Glasir), and users (Ernsts Express).We expect that the effect of the use of the solution in the project is a significant reduction in the use of diesel and reduction of CO2 emissions. Estimated reduction in diesel use in Sweden is approx. 5-10% of fuel consumption per vehicle and in southern Europe this reduction can be significantly greater (approx. 20% less fuel consumption). We expect that the project\u00b4s solution, in addition to environmental benefits, will also generate economic value, partly through reduced fuel costs, and partly through new innovations based on the solutions in the project.",

By using passenger and freight trains as carriers of robust and autonomous sensors, a greater amount of information about the status of the facility will be created. The goal of the project was to test and develop a cloud-based solution and business model for a scalable implementation of the magnetic field-based sensor for the inspection of railway fasteners.The project\u00b4s work consisted of two parts. The first part dealt with the development of the cloud-based algorithm for the synchronization of measurement data from various measurements via trains in operation. This work relied on measurements from trains in operation. The work included a number of technical and practical challenges as the measurements had to be adapted to the schedule of the locomotive. The task required not only software work but also changes in hardware solutions. The part with the business situation was more theoretical and contained fewer practical problems.The project resulted in a developed method for how the information from a measurements sensor for railway fastener inspection should be analyzed and handled in a context where a fleet of sensors is installed on a variety of trains and operators. In this way, different measurements can now be synchronized with each other so that changes in the fastener status can be monitored.The project also resulted in a description of how a system of sensors can be implemented in Sweden or internationally where different business interests and incentives are taken into account.",

The first stage, allowed all parties to collect information and share processes, to determine if anything in the respective workflows was going to incompatible. The second stage saw RMIT work with the collected information to devise a testing and simulation program to optimise the existing propeller and maintain manufacturability.

This data could be captured by real sensors or by simulative components to turn retroactive validation and verification(V&V) strategies, which is driven by real-world recordings only, into a proactive V&V strategy. This would allow for a systematic testing of an adjusted software feature before it is deployed.The project will tackle challenges originating from a multi-stakeholder analysis in WP2 and derive a gap analysis from it. WP3 will then develop joint running case studies for different strategies within the project. WP4 will drive the work of the case studies, where amongst others an open virtual test framework will be explored to generate open results. WP5 will then perform tests and evaluate the strategies developed. Results generated in WP5 is fed back into WP4 to refine developed strategies. WP1 handles project management and dissemination of results.A successful strategy would allow all involved actors along the value chain of validating and verifying software-driven vehicle features, to more efficiently allocate the right testing resources, in the right quality, and with the expected degree of fidelity at the most pressing challenges driven by information from the field. An expected effect is that vehicle industry increases their testing efforts with regards to ADAS and AD testing, without the same need for expanding track and open road testing.",

A framework for creating scenarios to describe the problem space has been published. From scenarios, capability needs are explored and capabilities designed. With a system perspective on capabilities, the project\u2019s focus has been on designing two components: technology and tactics. Methods to develop these in concert are studied, starting with a structured literature review, leading to the development of design support (methods, models, and tools).The original project plan was initially followed. When methods for exploring the design space of the tactical space were studied, it became apparent that the complexity arises from it being both a socio-technical system and a multi-level system due to hierarchies in today\u2019s SoS, such as in a defense system. Therefore, it was decided to conduct a more thorough analysis of the research area before continuing the work on developing design support. This led to some delay in the publication of the third research article, which will conclude the licentiate thesis, aimed for 2024Q4.A framework for scenarios as a description of the problem space for the development of SoS and systems has been developed and published in Aerospace. The framework has been applied at Saab and in EU projects. The research area CONOPS exploration for design of SoS and technical systems has proven to be less mature than initially thought, requiring a shift in the project. Key results for future implementation and research come from a structured literature review (not yet published), which maps the area and provides insights on how design support for CONOPS exploration can be developed.",

System development, integration, and adaptations that enable smart control of the chargers have been carried out. SMS based booking system has been developed.  The system is designed to receive information from travelers such as how long they must be parked. The information is used for various types of optimization to achieve cost savings, peak power creations and at the same time ensure that the traveler receives the charge they desire. The system enables future revenue from flex and support services markets.The project was carried out with 3 sub-projects:System for customer communication. (Swedavia)System for control of charging points. (Recap)Integration. (Swedavia, Recap, and external sources)The project used agile project models with sprints planned and executed in two-week cycles. A number of workshops were carried out as well as steering group meetings every month in the first year. The delays were mostly due to the integrations that were required between different systems. The experience here points to a central integration platform acting as a master for all functions.The pattern of behavior is that there are two peak periods during a week when travelers arrive and depart from the airport. Without control, power peaks then occur, which, if the number of charging points were greater, would cause capacity problems. Many travelers have systems for heating and other things active while they are parked, which results in high energy consumption if they are parked for a long time. If the number of kWh is limited, it means that they do not have as much energy as they would like on departure, which is a problem discovered within the project.",

The method of stabilizing and creating a hydraulically tight barrier through ground freezing will thereby be able to be chosen from several perspectives; economically, production-technically, and in terms of nature and work environment.The goal of this project is to verify the method for artificially frozen constructions with a high content of fine soil from a sustainability perspective.In an initial stage, a compilation of data from the artificial ground freezing project Bothnia Railway is carried out, which is theoretically analysed. Additional data from the thawing soil next to Stranneberget is collected and compared. The results are evaluated and compiled in a report that later results in two scientific articles.The results of the studies will clarify the long-term effects of the freezing method on soil after thawing, so that unexpected effects do not arise from stress changes and settlements.The results will be of great benefit to the construction industry and infrastructure clients who will be able to drive tunnels and build facilities in a safe way where freezing can be used as a temporary stabilizing and sealing method.",

New experimental data are generated through tunnel testing on simplified geometries and are used to further develop, verify and validate the rCFD solution for pollution problems relevant to vehicle aerodynamics. In the next step, new experimental data is generated for a real vehicle. The rCFD solver is validated for this actual case and then the behavior of different types of contaminants is examined and guidelines are compiled.The project results can be summarized as: 1) A validated rCFD methodology (solver and associated working methods) for virtual real-time prediction of sensor soiling; 2) Knowledge of differences and similarities between different contaminants in terms of soiling of realistic vehicle bodies; 3) General guidelines for sensor positioning based on rCFD simulations.

Microstructure and mechanical properties will be evaluated. In addition, life cycle analysis is performed for selected process paths, and the economics of possible processes are evaluated.The goal is to find out in which cases low-alloy additively manufactured components for prototypes and spare parts are a good alternative to traditionally manufactured transmission components, both in terms of mechanical properties and economy and environment.

We aim to modernize the regulatory framework in collaboration with a wide range of relevant stakeholders. Our goals are to improve the accessibility of shared cars, even in areas where they are currently lacking, and to reduce the need for car ownership (and lower parking requirements). At the same time, it is crucial to ensure a serious and secure market for shared vehicles.The project addresses these issues through a policy lab approach involving various stakeholders. Besides this, the government granted Sk\u00f6vdebost\u00e4der an exemption from the car rental regulation. We will now test the situation where a housing company shares a number of its vehicles with tenants through a platform operator in a combined car pool with the tenants\u00b4 own vehicles. We test new business models and assess the potential, opportunities, risks, and challenges associated with compined car pooles.The project contributes to the following effects and results:- increase the amount of shared vehicles and thereby increase the utilization rate of vehicle fleets through a broader and more accurate regulatory framework - create greater security for individuals by removing regulatory challenges that exists for an active sharing private person- develop a structure and principles for a more modern regulatory framework that facilitates sharing services, which in turn lead to a more efficient use of vehicles, street space and increased accessibility to modern vehicles",

An extension or reuse is desirable from a circular perspective because these systems carry a relatively high manufacturing cost and environmental burden. The work will be based on existing regulations and identify the opportunities and limitations that exist. The project is also looking in to reuse in applications other than the initially intended.The project is carried out with representatives from industry, academia and research institutes. The work begins with a workshop where the detailed internal distribution of the work and a consensus on the task is established. During the project, coordination meetings will be held where possible issues that have arisen can be discussed based on the different backgrounds and perspectives of the project members. At a final meeting, the results of the will be coordinated and summarized in a report. The content and conclusions will be presented at an open seminar at the end of the project.Currently, there is no compilation of known research, rules or standards for how a lifetime extension or how other use would be handled. This project will investigate the regulatory technical conditions that need to be taken into account when extending life. This work identifies enablers and obstacles together with an international strategic analysis of the state of knowledge. The information will provide a picture of how regulations will need to be evaluated and probably also adjusted to allow for life extension.",

The research includes new methods that reduces the reliance on a planning phase and pre-planned flight patterns, while allowing more flexible radar waveforms and, finally, fewer assumptions about the nature of the ground returns, target signals and direct signals. This opens up a greater operational envelope and flexibility for a AMR system. This also opens up for capable AMR systems to be fitted to a wide range of airborne platforms; from small drones to large aircrafts.The project implementation includes a fundamental modeling of the problem. The problem scope is considered from both an operational and technical perspective. The operational perspective involves identifying relevant scenarios for an AMR, while the technical perspective builds on models and methods from earlier projects (from NFFP7, NFFP8 Call1 and other Saab academic collaboration projects).The project includes regular meetings between the parties. It will also include workshops and seminars for the dissemination and discussion of results, both at Chalmers and at Saab.The project will help to turn earlier challenges and limitations into enablers for an AMR. The anticipated results are methods than can effectively extract information for all platforms in an AMR. It will do this by exploiting information in what has earlier been severe challenges in terms of direct signal, ground clutter echoes and target echoes. The project strengthens both partners\u2019 expertise in advanced methods for AMR systems. In turn, this contributes to Chalmers\u2019s position in this area and to Saab\u2019s competitiveness for advanced radar systems.",

Objective (1) has not been fully achieved. However, knowledge of challenges linked to the goal has been identified and development methods based on simulations and transfer to a real environment have been developed and partially validated. Goals (2) and (3) have been achieved in the project.The project has been carried out in collaboration between Volvo CE (VCE) in Eskilstuna, Lule\u00e5 University of Technology (LTU), and \u00d6rebro University (\u00d6RU). The collaboration has built on frequent, typically weekly, online meetings between LTU and \u00d6RU, and monthly reconciliations with VCE. In addition, meetings have been held between VCE and LTU to prepare and carry out experiments. In the latter part of the project, successful methods have been established to carry out experiments in Eskilstuna from Lule\u00e5. This has been very important and enabled effective collaboration.The project has resulted in lessons learned about challenges associated with using cameras to automate navigation in the short cycle loading cycle. In addition, the project has identified difficulties in using machine learning models with reinforced learning linked to positional data for such navigation. The project results suggest that an agent trained in a simulation environment with reinforcement learning can bridge the gap between simulation and reality to complete a simplified version of the navigation task.",

Being able to do this in a flying demonstrator in a flexible way so that components and control laws can be easily changed will be a challenging task.The implementation and project layout is based on the data that is available on the existing demo platform, GFF, and to create a simulation framework for this in a way that makes it easy to implement and test different control laws for the flight tests. A radio-controlled demonstrator will be 3D-printed and put together with other systems such as sensors, avionics and landing gear. When the control laws have been verified and validated in the simulation environment, they will be implemented in the demonstrator and then test flown. The results will be analyzed and reported.The expected effect is that new types of control laws can be used in the work on next-generation fighter aircraft that is underway in Sweden. Testing of new innovative control laws, using the proposed method, mitigates high-risk or unforeseen problems by being able to print new parts. In this way, efficient testing can be carried out in design projects. This will reduce time and costs for a project.The result is that a flying demo platform is available to test new control laws. This can give Swedish aeronautical research a benefit in international research projects.",

The project has prepared an implementation of three system demonstrations where digitalization and data sharing are a prerequisite to minimize transportation of materials in a circular economy with increasing material fractions.A transition to circular flows requires major changes in the ecosystem (value chain) including planning and requirements already in the procurement phase. Identification of materials, access and quality, new types of vehicles, load carriers, storage locations and business models is also essential. New business models, but also real obstacles within policy and regulations in procurement process, must be studied in a Business model lab or Policy model lab. About fifteen data parameters that describe the type of material, nature, number of fractions - also need to be developed.In line with Drive Swedens\u00b4s performance goals, the preliminary study has identified three full-scale pilot studies where a digitized construction logistics chain forms a foundation for efficient information sharing. The expected effect is to eventually achieve a national impact of stated environmental goals within the three market segments demolition, renovation and new production. Another expected results is that new business models will be developed, but also that material hubs for intermediate storage of materials are being established.",

            "Description": "This project addresses the need to develop a method that predicts how the composite\u00b4s mechanical properties change over time and with thermomechanical loading. In the project, a calculation methodology is developed that describes the occurrence and growth of damage in composites that are exposed to quasi-static or cyclic multiaxial loads during thermal and mechanical fatigue. The methodology is part of an experimental modeling methodology that is fundamentally based on an understanding of relevant physical damage mechanisms at the micro- and meso-scale.The project has been coordinated by GKN and largely carried out practically by a doctoral student at LTU. All work packages have been completed during the course of the project. These include project management, literature review, development of the model, fabrication of vouchers, experimental validation and dissemination of the project. All partners in the project have a well-established collaboration that contributed to the success of the project.The project has developed a unique tool in the form of a material model for service life forecasts for composite components. In particular, a computational methodology describing the initiation and growth of damage in composites subjected to quasi-static and cyclic multiaxial loading combined with hygrothermal cycling was developed, based on the understanding of the relevant physical damage mechanisms. Significant time and cost savings in future test and qualification programs are expected when the proposed method is combined with mechanism-based models.",

            "Description": "Traditional methods of diagnostics are only utilised when faults become apparent, usually through physical symptoms or fault codes, making the process reactive rather than preventive. Although effective to a certain extent, these traditional methods are challenged by the complexity and interconnectedness of today\u00b4s modern vehicle systems. This results in a diagnostic process that is both time-consuming and costly. The pre-diagnostic strategies we propose in the PRIDE project aim to automatically identify potential problems before they develop into more serious faults.Recent advances in AI and Machine Learning technologies enable such radical developments by providing tools for analysing the information stored in large amounts of vehicle data, and exploiting subtle signs of component degradation that may not necessarily result in fault codes. We will utilise \"ranking data\", a rich source of information that is commonly used to generate fault codes but underused in predictive diagnostics. The PRIDE project is coordinated by CAISR (Centre for Applied Intelligent Systems Research) at Halmstad University, with Volvo GTT as the key partner.State-of-the-art AI systems can identify complex patterns that indicate upcoming failures, streamlining the diagnostic process, reducing repair times and lowering costs. Such a preventive approach is particularly critical and important for the most vital components, including the engine, where early detection of failures can prevent serious engine breakdowns and thereby also reduce the subsequent logistical and economic consequences. Our solution will complement the established workshop routines and support faulty vehicle inspections to find the cause of the problem.",

The primary emphasis is on generating facial images, with driver authentication being one of the application areas where these methods is tested.Two methods have been explored within the project in order to both capture direct use and future relevance in industry applications. Each with their own advantages, for example the Basel Face Model is easier to use for commercial purposes as the Generative Adversarial Networks are pretrained on datasets for research purposes and would need to be retrained. On the other hand, Generative Adversarial Networks are among the most realistic models currently.Two methods for feature disentanglement have been tested. One utilizing Basel Face Model and another one with Generative Adversarial Networks. The results have shown that the improvements made in this project to the Basel Face Model allow us to generate data evenly distributed across several attributes such as gender and ethnicity, which can better balance models trained on biased datasets, reducing their bias. Our new method related to the Generative Adversarial Network also shows promising results in its ability to encode image information into a disentangled latent space.",

The size of the effect is dependent on the status of the cooling systems. The result shows the possibility of shifting some electrical power even in the event of worse system conditions, but the total electrical energy use may then be unchanged or higher.",

The goal is partly to validate that the company\u00b4soffer meet the industrial partner\u00b4s needs, and partly to develop a structure for a potential longterm partnership.Expected result is that the program develops a process / model for how to best facilitate and accelerate partnerships between Swedish vehicle manufacturers and small and medium-sizedcompa nies. Partnerships between large and small companies are value-creating for both parties. Large companies get access to innovation in fast cycles as well as new technology, new business models and new skills. Small and medium-sized companies get an entrance to a potential customer as well as access to experience regarding the industry, industrialization, upscaling and access to new markets.",

Heat transfer has been studied in depth and accurate measurements have been collected. The additional heat transfer measurements have been performed for several configurations in order to supplement aerodynamic studies.A state-of-the-art design and an Ultra-Efficient turbine structure has been studied at the Chalmers LPT-OGV facility under different engine representative conditions. The flow has been mapped in detail using a variety of flow measurement techniques, and the convective heat transfer on the surfaces has been obtained using an IR-thermography based technique. The performance of the Ultra-Efficient design were then evaluated based on the measurements. Also using the experimental results, post-test CFD analysis and CFD validation has been performed.The project has produced the required experimental data for increasing the maturity of an UltraEfficient turbine structure to a TRL 5. The experimental data have also been used for validation of methods for aerodynamics loss predition. The results have led to improved design tools and increased understanding of important flow phenomena which will allow us to improve the design of engine structures in general, including those in the front end of the engine.",

When most of the simple tasks are easily handled by an algorithm, the edge cases will necessarily be complex, time sensitive, or outside the norm. In these situations, remote operators play a crucial role, stepping in when the autonomous vehicle (AV) encounters scenarios it cannot safely or swiftly resolve.This project will bring together designers, philosophers, and technologists to develop new visions of the future as fully immersive Extended Reality (XR) experiences as a commentary on the current state of AVs and their potential future use cases. We will also highlight the operational challenges and the often-overlooked human labor essential for making these vehicles function effectively.This project is aimed at designing a XR interactive vision of a future where these current trends come together to create an unequal, unsafe, and unwanted vision of our future society. By exposing people today to possible future situation where they must quickly perform only the most stressful and complex of mobility tasks, in quick succession, under economic and social constraints that give them no other option we hope to encourage designers, developers and end users of these technologies to ensure that it does not come to pass.",

By focusing on women, our hypothesis is that accessibility also increases for other users of transportation systems. The goal of the project is to develop a guide for planning, designing, and building infrastructure and services that can lower emissions, address gender-based equity issues and serve the more vulnerable users of transportation.The approach for Design Framework for Women-Centered Mobility Hubs is to proceed from knowledge harvesting to deep conversations with women and caregivers in Sweden and USA, in order to build a framework for mobility hubs - the physical design, the data gathering, the services, the amenities, and the experience - to cater to women and caregivers first. The project is organized with core components of knowledge sharing, stakeholder dialogues, and conceptual design workshops. The project structure enables the iteration of findings and project results to deliver proof of concept.Shared mobility can lower emissions, address equity, and increase access, especially when paired with visible and accessible infrastructure in mobility hubs. This project will develop a deeper understanding of the physical, digital, informational and institutional infrastructure needed to create and support women-centered mobility hub systems. The Design Framework could be a vital tool for a just transition to low- or zero-carbon transportation systems in the US, Sweden, and across the globe. The project is expected to create a platform for new investments to equalize mobility.",

The developed models will make it easier to reduce material extraction through increased use of circular, thinner and more advanced materials that are demanding to join.Participants in the project consist of people with deep knowledge in production and spot welding, and in machine learning (ML). In the start-up of the project, time will be used to find a common language. Then relevant production data must be retrieved, after which the data must be curated and significant data translated into data language. Several different ML algorithms will be evaluated and combined, then trained against the acquired and curated data sets. When the final model is chosen, it will be tested in a demonstrator in industry.The new predictive intelligent digital control system developed in the project, will make a leap forward in the quality assessment of RSW, the most used joining method within automotive.The project addresses the FFI sub-programme\u2019s mission 2b), \u201cSocial sustainability throughout the value chain, e.g., Retain employees and attract new skills through techniques and solutions for cognitive and physical support ...\u201d.

RWIS are costly, require maintenance and are not scalable in the same way as connected vehicles. Connected vehicles in turn are a more scalable way to acquire measurement data, the down side is that they only measure a subset of RWIS.The goal was to develop a prototype for virtual RWIS stations and then during the winter investigate whether it would be useful for a municipality\u00b4s winter road maintenance.The setup for the project was to 1. Interview the end user about their problems and needs.2. Develop a software service that covers the needs.3.a. The end user tests the service sharply during the winter.3.b. Use, results and feedback are discussed during project meetings4. Act on feedback and make corrections in service5. Draw conclusions about the usefulness of the service.At the beginning of winter, an unforeseen quality problem with the modeling of the road surface temperature was also discovered. A development effort was carried out and the problems were fixed.The prototype that was produced was not considered valuable or useful enough for winter road maintenance. The reason was that it only presented current state data. Winter road management did not feel that it provided sufficient information as a decision support system. They need forecasts and thus this tool cannot compete with free services such as SMHI.On the other hand, the municipality discovered great value in the road friction data. Not as support for decision-making, but rather to be able to follow up the outcome of winter road maintenance for the first time.",

            "Description": "The project aims to identify algorithms and data for non-destructive testing of 3D printed structures. A suitable algorithm based on an identity between measured scattering data and a sensitivity measure in the volume of the sample based on simulations of a reference object has been identified and investigated numerically. The results show good possibilities for realizing a measurement system with a fast enough response time to provide input data to a digital twin in production control.The project has been carried out as part of a doctoral project at Lund University. Participating industry contributed with problem formulation, project management and feedback at the regular project meetings, which, in addition to physical visits in Lund by the project manager, have been held as video meetings to reduce time and cost of travel. The collaboration has worked well, where the industry\u00b4s needs have been clearly communicated and demonstrated relevance for the developed solution.The project results demonstrate that a measurement system can be designed to determine deviations in electromagnetic properties from a reference case in a 3D printed structure. With the help of pre-computed simulations of the reference object, a quick evaluation of the position, shape and degree of deviations can be determined, and with the help of measurements on a physical reference object, additional accuracy can be obtained. This makes the method well suited as part of production control of electromagnetic properties.",

The problem to be approached is the development of an integrated multi-agent mission planning system that not only coordinates agents and actions to achieve complex mission goals, but also includes interaction actions and data/knowledge producing actions required to achieve such goals. Consequently, physical actions, data/knowledge producing actions, and interaction actions, become part of the mission planning process. The resultant multi-agent mission plans include all three types of actions in a plan when executed.This project is highly collaborative with its industrial partner, Saab Aeronautics, both in spirit and concretely in terms of specific work packages to involve Saab Aeronautics directly in the research proposed. The project will be pursued in the context of state-of-art national research arenas, and will use sophisticated experimental UAVs and ground robotic systems from both LiU and Saab for active experimentation. This is a unique and important aspect of the project that provides the ability to field test all research ideas using complex, heterogeneous teams of UAVs.The goal of this project is to provide a formal framework and software system for supporting knowledge intensive interaction among teams of agents, both human and robotic, in relevant scenarios, as a basis for generating mission plans. The primary focus is to support a spectrum of automated mission planning techniques to achieve complex goals. One of the unique novelties of this project is to deeply integrate data and knowledge acquisition and interaction into the actual mission planning and execution processes.",

At the same time, it will free up administrative resources and generate financial savings in lower logistics costs for the e-tailers.A well-functioning service should also increase both supply and demand for repair services. Increased demand leads to increased reuse of clothing and lower environmental impact, while increased supply leads to more job opportunities, which in turn leads to lower unemployment and increased equality.",

Insights from the preliminary study for the project showed that nudging has the potential to increase the use of car sharing in apartment buildings in combination with other attitudinal interventions. The goal has been to fully test and evaluate four packages with nudging and information in at least four properties that have an existing car sharing service.The goal has been fulfilled as nudges and economical incentives have been tested in five properties which has led to new insights.Initially, interviews and surveys were conducted with the residents of each housing property to understand travel habits, and reasons to use car sharing. Based on the results, 2 nudges were tested in 2 properties in round 1, as well as a financial incentive in one property. The nudges were followed up through surveys, interviews and statistics of registrations and bookings. The nudges were then further developed and adapted to each property for round 2. 4 packages were tested in 5 properties. The results were followed up and analyzed through surveys and user statistics.The number of registered users or bookings has increased marginally due to the interventions neither because of the nudges nor the financial incentives. Meetings and personal contact have been experienced more positively by the residents than digital information efforts. Lessons learned are that interventions should be carried out from move-in and continuously at regular intervals, nudges, messages and forms of communication should be varied, dialogue with board of association is very important, presence on site is a key factor, and that good physical conditions are necessary.",

The goal is to initiate a dialogue about our relationship with animals and nature, their inherent values, and the potential, yet untapped, benefits for our well-being in an increasingly urbanised world where challenges such as built, hard surfaces for housing and roads are becoming more prominent. Through this dialogue, we strive to understand people\u00b4s thoughts and feelings about a possible future coexistence with animals and nature in urban environments.The project is divided into three work packages. In WP1 (May-September), foresight methodology is used to develop and deepen the future scenario, for example, through environmental scanning and signal spotting. In WP2 (August-December), an iterative design process is used to design and create a future prototype to embody the future scenario. The result is a future prototype that provides the experience of an ecological corridor for mobility. WP3 (May-January) aims to disseminate the future prototype and gather insights from visitors\u00b4 experiences of the prototype.1: An in-depth future scenario that is clearly anchored in signals and societal challenges we observe today.

The main goal was to create a proof-of-concept. While more time is needed to verify that the AI models can be made to perform adequately on real-world images, our results are encouraging, and we will continue to develop our solution.Work on the synthetic data generation platform and the office laboratory ran in parallel during much of the fall of 2023. Several unexpected challenges were encountered, such as difficulties in isolating the projected patterns in the synthetic and real-world images, and finding a way to automatically label the damaged parts. While good working solutions were found to all these challenges, the AI modelling, which was planned to start in August, had to be postponed until the end of November.We have successfully built a highly versatile platform for synthetic data generation. The platform, which uses Blender, allows for light pattern projection  a technique that potentially makes damage detection easier  onto any geometry. We have also created a simple office laboratory setup for real-world pattern projection and image capturing, that mimics our software platform. Further development of this solution has the potential to open for wider adoption of computer vision in industry.",

The emphasis will be on developing algorithms for fusion and situation assessment and prediction based on Evidence Theory, as well as adaptive human-machine interfaces (HMI). To achieve this, data are combined from external sources via a cloud platform and internal sources such as driver monitoring. The goal is to evaluate these new ADAS in terms of safety, efficiency, and user experience.The project is divided into 4 work packages. WP1 focuses on refining the two use cases. WP2 will develop a research platform incl. the cloud platform and analytics for data exchange between vehicle and infrastructure, data fusion and situation assessment algorithms utilizing Evidence Theory and adaptable HMI. WP3 will integarte these systems into truck demonstrators that will be evaluated in WP4 with truck drivers. Partners are: Sk\u00f6vde University, Scania, Smart Eye and Viscando.Two proof-of-concept prototypes will be developed for next-generation ADAS for trucks, one addressing intersection crashes with cyclists and one addressing overtaking crashes with passenger cars. These systems will include new data sources as well as fusion methods and situational assessment techniques. Together with innovative HMI solutions, this is expected to increase the acceptance of ADAS among drivers and result in increased use throughout the journey. The results are disseminated via articles and an external reference group.",

The work was delayed because halfway through the project we chose to change the video library from G-streamer to ffmpeg, where we could overcome a limitation in G-stream. This experience is important for future further development of the project\u00b4s functionalities.The module developed in the project has been tested on hardware that can be used on board.The project adds interesting functions, increasing the interest in Spacemetric\u00b4s Keystone software for old and new customers. The project has also given us ideas for more abilities that we need to develop. These capabilities include being able to change the metadata without destroying the geometric information so that we can subsequently improve the geometric accuracy of a video stream, e.g. by creating orthorectified video streams.",

Today there is little knowledge about implementing changes in complex socio-technical systems. More knowledge is needed concerning how to work with transformation to achieve desired effects and avoid unwanted effects. Here, the transport sector is an important player, and improvements in efficiency and sustainability in freight transport are essential for both society and industry.The project is carried out within the scope of two doctoral student projects and includes the development of a demonstrator with support from researchers and engineers at Scania. The project\u00b4s collaboration between Scania, KTH, and the research center Integrated Transport Research Lab (ITRL) enables a continued knowledge exchange between the parties and close cooperation between academia and industry. The project\u00b4s scope is interdisciplinary, and several different competencies will be involved. In total, STIFF consists of four work packages.Expected deliveries in the project are a strategy, vision, and tactics for service market support and design proposals for intelligent decision support. STIFF will also deliver knowledge concerning how to carry out sustainable and desirable transformations of complex socio-technical systems. It is interesting knowledge from an academic perspective and for the industry because there is a change in, for example, the transport sector.",

The purpose of Tj\u00e4nstskjuts 2.0 is to deepen and verify these findings by following pilot activities that are now being prepared in Karlstad municipality and Region Stockholm. The goal is to produce a method guide, free for municipalities and other organizations to use based on their own conditions.Karlstad municipality and Region Stockholm carry out their pilot activities under their own auspices. The project, led by IVL Svenska Milj\u00f6institutet, supports the pilots with research support, calculation help, acceptance studies and evaluation. Acquired knowledge and experiences are later presented in a method guide, produced by Klimatkommunerna and Svenska Taxif\u00f6rbundet. These parties are also responsible for further dissemination of results in the form of webinars and presentations at external conferences.The pre-study showed that a shift to service shuttles can reduce direct costs, environmental disturbance, take up less street and parking space, contribute to better public health and a more efficient working day, and create a better local labour market and integration. The pilot operations in Karlstad and Stockholm are expected to confirm and dimension these societal benefits. The project contributes with research support, calculation help, acceptance studies and evaluation. The final product will be a method guide that will be distributed to both municipalities and contractors.",

Despite extensive data from connected vehicles, the automotive industry largely lacks this understanding. To address this gap and enable ADAS designers to make informed user-centered decisions, this pre-study aims to explore the integration of real-world fleet data into ADAS user evaluation by means of data-driven methods relying on techniques such as ML, data mining and predictive modeling.There are three work-packages (WP1-3). WP1 deals with project management. WP2 investigates what knowledge about real-world usage of ADAS is needed to optimize user evaluation and design of ADAS. Using Scania as a use case, we will create an inventory of relevant data that is being collected from vehicles and investigate relevant data-driven methods and tools. This will inform WP3, where we aim to conduct a gap analysis between the needs and possibilities and establish an initial understanding of how data-driven methods could be utilized in evaluation and design processes of ADAS.Through literature surveys, interviews, and workshops with researchers and designers, we will: a) identify what insights about ADAS usage are needed by ADAS designers and what data is currently collected from the real-world ADAS usage (with Scania as a case study), b) propose initial ideas on leveraging data-driven methods to extract relevant insights from such data, and c) outline a direction for a full-scale project where a proof-of-concept is developed to advance methods for user-centric ADAS evaluation.",

Realized through development of business models for circularity, as well as development of policies and regulations to create incentives and policy instruments that favor conversion and reuse. The goal is to be able to reach net zero emissions by 2030 for larger vehicle fleets, by cost-effectively removing diesel-powered vehicles from the total fleet.In the project, Rearq will electrify used diesel vehicles, which are identified using a number of selection criteria, from MatHem\u00b4s vehicle fleet. Chalmers will evaluate circular business models through a network of actors to create the conditions to scale up volumes. With the help of Power Circle, the project drives issues linked to policies and regulations that are deemed important to be able to use conversion as a tool for transitioning towards sustainable transportation.We want to be able to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and environmental benefit of reusing and converting transport vehicles, by establishing new ecosystems to enable large-scale conversion. Furthermore, we want to ensure that policies, regulations and incentives are adapted and introduced to promote cost-effective conversion.",

The initial goal was to involve three operations, but the project has succeeded in involving five operations. The methodology is inspired by another municipal company in Uppsala that has reduce power peaks in school kitchens with good results.Facilities initially covered: Bathhouse Fyrishov (sauna),Viktoria fire station (laundry), Uppsala concert and congress (kitchen) The following were added:Brasserie 21 (kitchen), Friggas City Hall (kitchen) The facilities now have high-resolution measurement that is connected to a platform that can display graphs and data. At all facilities, except Fyrishov, screens have been installed to be able to show the power situation in real time and they have received coaching on how to reduce power peaks. At Friggas, a technical system is being installed to control the power.The project has created a greater understanding of where power peaks are located in each of the participating operations and it has also created a greater awareness of energy issues among the operations staff.The kitchens have lowered their power peaksafter they got screens.The fire station\u00b4s laundry is more difficult to reduce power peaks because there is no timer function on the machines. The sauna can be started earlier to avoid peaking.",

These vehicles are then carrying out their normal duties and meanwhile data is automatically collected from the road environment. This data can then be presented to local authorities to enable better decisions to be made around operations and maintenance of the road environment, and more.By using vehicles that are already moving on the roads, we can reduce the number of vehicles that need to go out to keep track and make inventories of the road environment. Through proactive work when it comes to maintenance of the road surface and the road environment, both time and cost can be reduced. In addition, by extending the life of the road it\u00b4s also possible to point to significant environmental upsides. In addition, frequent insights from the road enable a safer environment for all road users, including vulnerable road users.",

The project has also developed a survey.Case studies from two different domains have been conducted  self-driving buses and self-driving industrial trucks. Interviews have been conducted with developers, customers and end users. A survey has been developed to measure safety culture, gender equality culture and sustainability culture in organizations that develop self-driving vehicles. In addition to this, data from incident reports has been analyzed. A process model where safety culture is integrated into the development of self-driving vehicles and machines has been worked out via workshops.The process model for including safety culture in the development of autonomous vehicles and machines is expected to contribute in the long term to a more customer-focused approach where the conditions for end use are identified at an earlier stage. It is hoped that this will contribute to increased safety, but also efficiency, in the use of the autonomous vehicles and machines. From a more short-term perspective, knowledge of safety culture has increased within the project team during the implementation of the project.",

Initially conceived as an exploration into fully autonomous systems, the focus shifted towards developing decision support mechanisms. This shift was motivated by the versatility of decision support, which can cater to the needs of both pilots and autonomous aircraft. The research contributed to academic advancement in the field through a Ph.D. thesis and fostered industrial innovation.The industrial Ph.D. student had a master\u00b4s degree in aeronautical engineering, but had to study machine learning from scratch for the research assignment. This has gone well, and he has produced several strong publications in the field and also written a Ph.D. thesis to be presented and defended in public. The Ph.D. student has developed a decision support tool to help operators in Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air combat scenarios assess the risks of different options and make decisions based on those. The results have been presented at a scientific conference.Throughout the project, significant progress was made on the research front, including publications and presentations at the international conference ICUAS 2024. The articles form the basis for a Ph.D. thesis that shortly will be defended in public. An open-source Air Combat Beyond Visual Range was also developed to foster collaboration and facilitate experimentation within the research community. Fighter pilots at Saab have given positive feedback on our ideas and results. We are considering implementing the decision support concept in Saab\u00b4s development environment.",

The Swedish Transport Agency\u00b4s regulations and general advice on permission to conduct trials with automated vehicles have recently been changed. A general advice has been added that the companies\u00b4 own risk assessment in some cases should be supplemented with a statement from independent assessors about the road safety of the trial. However, there is no guidance on when a statement is needed and what it should cover. This is adressed by the project.In addition to an initial and comprehensive strategic analysis, the work has mainly been conducted through workshops and in-depth conversations with relevant actors. Through the workshop format, the different actors get the opportunity to meet in a neutral place to exchange experiences and perspectives. In a co-creative process based on Design Thinking-principer, specific questions have been raised regarding what an independent review might look like in practice and proposed solutions have been developed jointly by the participating stakeholders.** Denna text \u00e4r maskin\u00f6versatt ** The project result, which is presented in a research report, can be a guide for market players, authorities and examiners and the basis for a statement.",

By staging a future where the \"flexikant\" is the norm, we want to enable an experience where participants can try using this system to solve their everyday needs. The experience aims to create new conversations about which strategic choices we need to make in order for sustainable travel to become the norm.The project is based on Point\u00b4s process for strategic foresight, which combines a systematic and data-driven way of working to understand and analyze trends, with developing scenarios and artifacts through speculative design. We will work iteratively and produce different versions of the prototypes, first in a simpler form to create early learning, then to gradually make the prototype more concrete and interactive. The process is carefully documented to keep a clear common thread from trend, insight, scenarios and prototypes.The project wants to clarify and define the roles that actors within the mobility system will play in future mobility solutions, by stimulating a shift of focus in the system, from dealing with current limitations to instead actively exploring and adopting new business models that support and promote a sustainable and flexible mobility in the future. The result of the project is that it should have clarified how the change in norms affects current business models, systems and people who will use it.",

Connected Vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) can exchange critical information to improve safety and mobility for vehicles and vulnerable road users. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of defining a non-proprietary, communications-agnostic RSU platform architecture.The pre study will be conducted through five work packages. The main work packages will focus on examining the compatibility, interoperability etc of the main components of an RSU, namely, sensing systems and alerting systems. The focus will be on non functional requirements known as TIPPSS  Trust, Identity, Privacy, Protection, Safety and Security. Understanding the legal, security and privacy implications associated with the use of RSUs will also be a focal point of the preliminary study.The expected result is a feasibility report regarding the creation of an open and standardized architecture for Road Side Units. Developing open standards simplifies system complexity, enhances cost-effectiveness, promotes vendor neutrality, and ensures interoperability. This can eventually streamline implementation and maintenance, leading to faster deployments and ultimately contributing to reduced road fatalities. This project could form the foundation for an applied proof of concept demonstrating an open architecture for Road Side Units.",

            "Description": "This pre-study was a collaboration between LEVTEK SWEDEN AB and Dept. Automatic Control at Lund University, with the purpose of studying how advanced safety features can increase the safety of micromobility vehicles. The overall goal was to gain knowledge about safety systems and to understand and investigate the system requirements for ADAS for micromobility.All work packages were carried out as planned, and therefore the objectives of the pre-study can be considered achieved.First, common use cases, accidents, and existing systems and methods for ADAS were summarized. System requirements were then examined through modeling and computer simulations, as well as experiments on a prototype of LEVTEK\u00b4s vehicle. A number of components were evaluated and tested in an experimental ADAS system. The pre-study also resulted in a Master Thesis, which is planned to be completed in June 2024.The pre-study focused on how advanced safety systems that include sensor-based feedback, e.g., using a camera mounted on the vehicle, can be used to enhance the safety of micromobility vehicles. The results of the pre-study in the form of analyses, simulations, and experiments demonstrated the potential for such systems and provided a basis for which components, in terms of sensors and actuators, are suitable for the realization of the systems.",

Adhesive joints give the possibility of new material combinations and with longer service life. 2C-based bonding with a short curing time and secure geometry fixation is essential. The goal is a robust process for high-volume manufacturing with automated application of 2C adhesive and thus also reduced work environment risks.Business partners are strongly involved in the project with information about their respective application situations and requirements for the adhesive process with examples typical of their needs. These form a basis for the technical work and will be used to develop and generalize questions that can be studied and analyzed in a research environment. To begin with, the project will use existing resources within the project consortium for tests and experiments, but gradually it is intended to establish a more targeted research environment at RISE for this.A robust automated joining process for 2C adhesive has potential to rationalize and make production more efficient, but deep knowledge of the interaction between materials, equipment, application situation and process is required to give Swedish companies the competitive advantage it entails and also contribute to a resource-efficient use and thereby contribute to FFI\u00b4s impact target. The goal of the project is therefore an automatic handling of all parts of the process to obtain a stable robust process, optimized material consumption and minimized chemical risks for personnel.",

A postdoctoral student will be employed and will be at Volvo Cars for exchange during AP4 (design simulations). The results will be published in research articles (international peer-reviewed journals).The project will provide valuable insights into the VPPIM technology and its contribution to sustainability. We are looking for real-case requirements for a VPPIM design, in order to highlight its potential and drawbacks in terms of energy efficiency, reliability, and manufacturing.

WP1 coordinates and disseminates the results to important actors. In WP2 case studies of three merchants\u00b4 omni-channels are carried out. The case studies analyze extensive empirical data to understand the environmental impact of different types of omni-channels. WP3 addresses the impact of omni-channels on cities and rural areas by interviewing important actors in cities and processing partial results from WP2 in workshops. WP4 processes results from WP2 and WP3 to develop concrete guidelines.The project will result in a planning framework with concrete guidelines. That will guide and support both retailers and urban planners in how to think and act in order to create the conditions for sustainable retail. The ambition is to build new skills for both companies and municipalities regarding interaction and collaboration to create the conditions for environmentally sustainable omni-channels.",

Also, the goal was to create that concept so that it could be demonstrated to a larger audience. In such case, the concept would include a straightforward \"CONOPs\" and requirements specification, drawings, and computations, as well as a TRL review of important technologies. The investigation of the ship\u00b4s maximum standing and waiting time at sea was a crucial deliverable.We broke the project down into a number of work packages. Each very small work package produced outcomes that were directly related to the deliverables that were selected. That went reasonably well, but we learnt things along the way that changed the \"necessity\" and content of subsequent work packages. The plan served as a roadmap for us throughout the project, though.One illustration of this is the wing-sail, which was taken off early since it needed the capacity to steer without the use of an engine. The water jet and the need to deal with submerged icebergs were not compatible with this.The project\u00b4s results were successful. Thanks to the information the project generated, we were invited to two conferences (WMRC 2023 and RINA Surv 11). We will therefore get the chance to hear from international maritime rescue organizations. Also, we were able to demonstrate that, despite some technical difficulties for the specific size of craft we are studying, it is theoretically feasible to construct the system we propose. One of the most challenging tasks will be that of finding a propulsion system with the needed performance and operating profile.",

This coating will combine electrical and thermal conduction capabilities.  The end goal is to create efficient lighting strike protection for aircraft components made of carbon fiber reinforced polymers, effectively mitigating the impact of lightning strikes through enhanced electrical conductivity. The project focuses on improving the conducting properties of the graphenefunctionalized coating.Three work packages (WP-A, WP-B, and WP-C) are central to the project. WP-A (Chalmers-UFABC) aims to develop scalable technologies for producing conductive graphene-polymer nanocomposite coatings by optimizing their electrical and thermal conductivity. In WP-B (Chalmers), modeling and simulation are used to investigate the behavior of the LSP system under lightning strike conditions, optimizing the coating formulation and design parameters. The WP-C (Saab) involves experimental testing at the coupon level and evaluation of the conducting propertiesBy combining experimental activities, modeling, and simulation, the project seeks to achieve a groundbreaking coating system for aircraft safety. The project results will be communicated through scientific publications, project internal reports, and workshops.

            "Description": "Fatigue failures represent some of the most critical events, having an impact on the structural integrity of aero engine components. In welds failures typically arise from localized defects from manufacturing, which must be captured by inspection.Different simulation methods for weld life exist and will be investigated and validated to experimental tests in this project. By implementing advanced digital weld inspections and using digital twins in the new fatigue strength models, the weld life predictions will become more accurate.The project encompasses several work packages including: digital inspection of welds in aerospace components, development of enhanced fatigue life estimation models, extensive fatigue testing, exploration of sustainable development frameworks in production manufacturing and dissemination of results.Todays\u00b4 manual measuring techniques used to characterize weld surface geometries are time consuming and the ability to capture refined effects can be improved.Enhancing the understanding of quality impact and its\u00b4 connection to process parameters by introduction of digital twins can significantly reduce development durations and thereby strengthen the industries competitiveness and resource efficiency. The project will adopt the findings to develop new industry standards and design methodologies.",

Furthermore, we have also worked with the safety of the bridge, based on a human experience but also visually and aesthetically. To shed light on these questions, a workshop was held, which in itself was an objective within the project. The project has created a more refined product that can provide a climate-smart alternative to a concrete or steel bridge.The project has been carried out within the triple helix model of innovation, i.e. a close collaboration between academia (KTH), business (TBS, Gaia, Funkia) and the public sector (City of Stockholm). 3 parallel work packages (WP): WP1 Design, aesthetics and durability; WP2 Construction and load-bearing capacity; WP3 Administration, Communication and Marketing has been completed. WP2 and WP3 have delivered expected results within time and budget with support from WP3. The close collaboration between the group members has been necessary and rewarding to achieve the good results.An insight has been that bridge design is a very complex and interwoven design process, where a great common understanding of the various aspects that affect a bridge is necessary to reach good results. The project\u00b4s results are a step in the right direction towards the goals of Agenda 2030. This is because the bridge is mainly built from renewable and reusable materials. The proposed innovations that have been developed within the project promote an ecologically and economically sustainable transport infrastructure that contributes to climate-neutral transportation.",

Since the performance will continuously improve and new functions will be added, it has not been the goal in this project to reach as high a performance as possible, but more to show functionality. In order to be able to test several different types of traffic situations, sensors have been installed at four different locations which together cover many different traffic environments. The performance has then been analyzed.The results show that infrastructure-based measurements have good prospects for improving the traffic safety of automated vehicles in the long term. Above all, the feasibility study has been able to contribute to objective at subprogram level within FFI Trafiks\u00e4ker automatisering. It is mainly about integration between vehicles and infrastructure, including systems for vehicle location. The safety of road users outside the vehicle has also been an important part, and in follow-up projects this will be able to play a large role in helping to create safer automated vehicles.",

Objective during the project:- Identify and analyze behavioral patterns for changing travel habits- Develop strategy for more efficient commuting choices- Test and pilot a model for a new digital shared mobility service with (behavioral patterns as a starting point)  The project has analyzed travel patterns and behaviors, developed strategy and implemented a pilot.In order to obtain results from the project, the starting point has been to carry out an analysis of the employees of the participating organizations and identify areas where possible matches for shared work commuting are favorable. The service was structured in a single larger group for a larger matching basis instead of four individual groups with internal matching per organization.The strategy was based on behavioral and organizational psychology perspectives to explore and test incentives for using the service and the likelihood of behavior change.Surveys showed a good interest in carpooling as a way of commuting to work. The pilot also showed good volumes in terms of active users and generated rides. However, the number of requests for carpooling was few and completed carpooling was very few. The willingness to offer a place for carpooling was high, while the willingness to ride alone with a colleague was very low. During the pilot, the conditions in the organizations changed, which led to limited resources affecting the results. However, a number of activities have been carried out, which is why the expected effect is limited.",

Many relevant needs linked to the FlexGate concept have been identified and the corresponding functions and services have been evaluated and prioritized according to feasibility in terms of effects, economic viability, regulations, and practical feasibility. The project also produced various proposals for the next development stage.The backbone of the project has been 5 co-creative workshops with over 20 different participating organizations and companies. To be able to work with realistic conditions, the analysis has mainly been based on the ongoing development of a new city district in Fors\u00e5ker. The project has also studied a densification case in a socio-economically weaker area to identify differences in such applications. Conducting workshops gave the project participants the opportunity to influence, learn and network, but bilateral discussions are an important complement for a detailed analysis.There is a clear demand for increased functionality compared to today\u00b4s mobility houses and some needs exist already in the construction phase. This does not mean that additional services can be offered without a thorough analysis of necessary prerequisites and finding viable business models. Flexibility of use is essential to the concept, although possessing regulatory and technical challenges. This is both to optimize the financial value and to be able to adapt to future demands and needs. A central challenge is to coordinate many stakeholders across different development phases.",

The method will then be extended to biaxial thermomechanical loading, where limited published results exist. The verified method will be used to study AM produced materials. Considerable effort will be devoted to microstructural characterisation.Better understanding of the differences in fatigue behaviour between wrought and AM produced Inco718. The GKN strategic need can be summarized in two research questions, with the first expected to be addressed by this project:- How do the material properties and damage mechanisms differ between wrought and AM Inco718 when subjected to thermomechanical and bi-axial loading?- How can observations from laboratory conditions be utilized to describe and predict the behaviour of materials under the complex conditions found in an aircraft engine?",

The project also aims to strengthen national collaboration within Sweden, as well as to strength international academic ties between Sweden and Germany through collaboration there.The project is planned to be implemented in two technical Work Packages (WP) led by GKN Aerospace and KTH respectively, and one overall project management Work Package led by GKN. WP1 will be concerned with processing and utilizing experimental data from the Clean Sky 2 2-Spool Compressor Rig project, while WP2, led by KTH, will focus on validation of passive flow control technologies designed by KTH. Within each WP, various individual milestones have been planned and each set of milestones will be finalized by report produced by the responsible party.The results of Work Package 1 are expected to yield a detailed analysis of the experimental data collected from the 2-Spool Compressor Rig testing and the use of this data to validate the prediction methods used to design very short compressor ducts. Similarly the results of WP2 will result in the validation of the CFD methods used to analyse the ICD rig at TU Berlin as well as the optimization of the passive flow control design developed in ADA1 by KTH. The results of both WPs are expected to allow the design of shorter, more efficient compressor ducts which could be used in future engine designs.",

Company leaders, the usual users of CERO are replaced by children, where they are involved in the development of both the target scenario and concrete action plan. Region Gotland enables a test bed based on the children\u00b4s solutions with support of CERO to finally create lasting learning packages for further dissemination.FAKTUM is based on previous research combined with CERO model, a technical innovation solution which has previously only been applied to adults. The project contributes to increased and unique knowledge of the reasons behind the high number of car journeys to/from school and leisure activities. Cross-sector measures and solutions based on the model will be applied to create lasting results for sustainable and active mobility, with focus on children\u00b4s perspective. A basis for reduced climate impact and negative health effects for children, which can hopefully continue for life.",

Sensor data from SL\u00b4s vehicles & infrastructure are used and potential measures are assessed in financial Business Cases to speed up the implementation process. The goal is for the model, and a number of measures, to be implemented in SL\u00b4s traffic/systems during the project\u00b4s three years, and for the model to be made scalable to other railowners/operators with similar energy efficiency needs.Slightly simplified, TF provides data & prototype to a Model, and identifies with the operator MTR a number of potential areas in vehicles / infrastructure where there is potential for energy efficiency measures. The areas derived from practice are paired with results from current research by KTH, which becomes a guide for the development of the Model. It is used to forecast outcomes for concrete energy efficiency measures, and Business Cases are developed to assess the benefits, costs and feasibility of the measures that the parties jointly prioritize as most effective.The model accelerates the transition to sustainable transport infrastructure through concrete measures that contribute to reduced energy use, and lower and more stable power consumption, in rail traffic. As a results, an increase in capacity makes it possible to produce more public transport, at the same time as costs for public transport production are reduced. The model as a tool should, with some modification, be able to be used by other infrastructure owners, customers and operators to create transparency and knowledge sharing around decisions on energy saving measures.",

            "Description": "The project aims to investigate how a user-friendly and interactive driver support can facilitate the work of drivers of timber trucks and how the acceptance of a more centralized transport planning is affected by access to a decision support.The project has five objectives: 1) Perform a system analysis of the driver\u00b4s influence on transport efficiency2) Map existing information flows3) Identify gaps in today\u00b4s information flow as well as future needs4) Develop a conceptual outline for a driver support5) Anchor the results with stakeholders and prepare for scaling upThe project runs during the period 230815-240430. Skogforsk leads the project, which is carried out in collaboration with S\u00f6dra (transport orderer and own haulage company) and three smaller haulage companies. The work is organized in five work packages: WP1 System analysis, WP2 Mapping of information flows, WP3 Conceptual outline of driver support and WP4 Plan of scale-up. The work will be based on literature studies, interviews and workshops with relevant actors based on user-centred methods. The conceptual sketch will be developed in Figma.The forest transport system is complex and route choices are affected by changing factors such as weather and wind, varying demand and availability of road networks and pick-up points. The drivers make many decisions based on the current situation, but the lack of customized decision support risks contributing to system-level inefficiency. Electrification of timber trucks will add further complexity. The project is expected to contribute with the basis for the development of adapted driver support that contributes to a better working environment and higher transport efficiency.",

With the zone methodology, the data parameters and calculations developed during the prestudy, we come one step closer. But an important objective was to lay the foundation for a broader continuation project, which the project group considers to have been fulfilled.The execution was structured in five work packages to carry out the following: formulate analysis model, geographic scope and necessary parameters, acquisition of data, quantitative analysis and visualization, and recommendations for future studies and actions. The work was carried out in close dialogue and cooperation with involved actors for access to important data parameters and information that enabled method development and production of relevant results. A couple of workshops have been carried out where more actors involved in the work and discussion about continuation.The prestudy developed a methodology to increase the understanding of future needs for public charging infrastructure in cities. The methodology is based on a division of an urban area into smaller zones, allocation of data volumes, and calculations of the need for charging infrastructure per zone. The project has also resulted in a wider stakeholder group for a continuation project where the ambition is to further develop and scale up the methodology to a national perspective to support all the country\u00b4s cities and municipalities in the development of public charging infrastructure.",

A shapetag is a physical object in a location in reality and can be interpreted by a connected autonomous vehicle\u00b4s sensors for e.g. localization purposes. As each shapetag is uniquely designed, these can also be used to associate metadata with physical things.  In addition to the above technical aim, the project aims to investigate future collaborations between Pennsylvania State University and AstaZero.The project includes both online collaboration and physical visits where the teams work on implementation, integration, and testing at the respective facility.Initially, a test protocol for shapetag detection is created, with parameters such as shapetag size, lighting conditions, weather, and distance between shapetag and sensor. Then follows physical integration and testing of the shape-tag method at each facility. The results are then analyzed and conclusions are documented.Concurrently, funding opportunities for further collaborative projects are investigated.Accurate vehicle positioning can prevent collisions. In addition to this, improved vehicle localization increases efficiency, as smarter decisions can be made both locally in the car and at the vehicle fleet level, based on a flow optimization perspective. Shapetags can be 3D-printed and work in environments where GPS signals are not received. This promotes both sustainability and enables positioning in challenging situations, such as tunnels or in cities with tall skyscrapers. In addition, knowledge is transferred between the US and Sweden, and new collaborations are enabled.",

To enable climate-resilient cities (less sensitive to climate-related events) and increase confidence in these constructions.A main aim is that the new solutions are durable and do not require a lot of maintenance. It is therefore important that construction methods are verified. In addition, it is important that already built constructions are followed up in order to build experience.In order to implement these constructions widely and utilize their ability to handle both traffic loads, stormwater and trees, it is necessary that their long-term function be documented and that the information is widely disseminated. Therefore, we intend to: 1) Build and follow up new test surfaces and instrument these so that deformations, moisture and the living conditions of the trees can be followed up. 2) Evaluate existing multifunctional structures. 3) Produce information and education materials and hold a dialogue with municipalities and actors to share experiences.The effect of implementing more BGG constructions is that the load on stormwater pipes during intense rain is reduced. The peak flow can be delayed by using the street\u00b4s unbound rock material as a temporary delay reservoir. Trees and vegetation provide biodiversity but also a more pleasant climate. In addition, greenery and trees provide a more beautiful urban environment. The results are to be used, among other things, to simplify procurement by developing regulations for facility construction.",

This is a challenging task since the road surface is random and the radar response varies significantly as the sensor measures different areas. Our previous research at the microwave laboratory in Chalmers showed that the randomness of the surface can be handled if we use a full polarimetric radar. Within the project we developed a polarimetric radar sensor, which was able to detect a wet patch on the road surface from a vehicle in motion and in real time.In our earlier work we developed a method that can identify the condition of the road surface in front of a vehicle in motion before the wheels reach the sensed area. In this project we developed a compact radar sensor that can be integrated on a vehicle and tested in traffic. We tested two different approaches to build a polarimetric-radar. We used commercial chips for the 77-81 frequency band. Both prototypes were manufactured and proved to be working as expected. At the end of the project, the sensors were tested in traffic and were able to detect a wet patch on the road surface.The results from the project, the availability of functional sensor-prototypes and the fact that we use the same frequency band as automotive radars (77-81 GHz) are expected to attract attention from industry. We have already contact with 2 companies interested in our technology. Our expectations are that in near future we will be able to carry on tests as part of a pre-study.",

CFD and FEM calculations will be used and adopted. Verification is an important part of the project and will be carried out both for the flow pattern in the quench chamber as well as change in distortion of the component.The calculation tools are based on CFD calculations of flow conditions in gas quenching chambers at the component level as well as FEM calculations of the hardening of the steel during quenching, from hardening temperature to room temperature. The result is hardening results and shape changes and how they depend on process parameters, charging, steel type and component geometry. The project setup is based on selected company components to enable evaluation and demonstration of the results of the calculations with practical trials.The effect goal is to be able to sustainably manufacture new, complex and high-performance power-train-components by using calculation tools already in the design phase of a component to identify and improve geometries/product requirements that would otherwise be very difficult to manufacture.

What they have in common is that, to varying degrees, they require autonomous computer vision and navigation of drones close to the ground. After an extensive analysis, it can be concluded that the perfect solution for Nordluft is currently not possible. In the near term, Nordluft will instead use various limited solutions in the different applications. Implementation has begun through tests with radar and lidar sensors as well as planned more advanced systems.The project was carried out in two phases. Part 1 consisted of a feasibility study where available technology and solutions were studied, several meetings took place with suppliers to create a better practical understanding of capacity and pricing. The information picture was then compared with the company\u00b4s needs within the various applications. Results became an implementation plan for a range of inherently limited solutions, as a perfect solution was not deemed financially possible. In part 2, sensors began to be implemented and tests to be conducted. This work is ongoing.The conditions for commercialization of the various applications for drones in forestry are now, after the project, significantly improved. The result is a partially implemented plan for autonomous computer vision and navigation within a variety of applications. What has not already been verified in prototype tests is planned in detail and will be completed within the next 12 months. Within each application, there is now a clarity of what can be offered to the customer in the near term and what requires greater resource investment to be realized.",

            "Description": "This project stands as a pioneering endeavour to digitally transform the casting process in foundries, by integrating empirical measurements, numerical modelling, and machine learning within sand reclamation processes. The purpose of this project is to reduce the environmental impact of the sand recycling processes. The project aims to introduce a machine learning model for sand recycling to help foundries optimize process parameters, better manage their sand recycling process, optimize their material consumption and reduce the amount of casting defects.A machine learning project begins with gathering data from pertinent sources, which involves extracting vital manufacturing details, and formatting them appropriately. The project starts with gathering data on characteristics of raw materials like sand, binders, and additives incorporated into sand and core mixtures using unique tools and methodologies developed by project partners. After data collection, the data undergoes pre-processing to be able to produce and train a machine learning model tailored to enhance the sand recycling procedure and elevate casting quality.The project will develop  innovative models for more efficient sand reclamation and overall, a more stable casting process, which will contribute to a sustainable, resource efficient and circular production system. Expected results are to reduce the environmental impact of foundries by reducing the amount of sand waste and demand for new sand using machine learning model to optimize the sand recycling. The approach is to increase sand reclamation to its maximum while maintaining and/or improving the quality of castings.",

Taxis have low thresholds for becoming drivers and entrepreneurs.The study was also done to create a decision basis for a pilot study.The preliminary study\u00b4s hypothesis has been tested through both literature studies and cost calculations as well as a review of practical, organizational and legal circumstances. The preliminary study has also reviewed possible IT solutions. This procedure has also been followed.A start-up workshop was held in February 2023. The project was presented at a seminar in Almedalen 2023 and at Drive Sweden Forum in September 2023. Debriefing was held at the final seminar in September 2023. A workshop for interested in pilot project is planned with interested actors in October 2023The conclusion of the preliminary study is that a service shuttle solution can be of great benefit to society, seen in a broad perspective. The clearest potential social benefit lies in the organisation\u00b4s improved finances, in reduced need for parking spaces, in better public health and working environment for the employees, and in the possibilities for a strengthened local labour market. There is also good potential for reduced environmental impact and a more efficient working day. The  project partners recommend a next step in the form of a pilot project.",

The funding has meant that such an analysis has been carried out, which has led to increased knowledge about the practical and economic differences of switching from HVO to hydrogen operation in heavy transport tasks.The project has been carried out by Gustav Green (RISE) in collaboration with mainly Stay Fresh Sweden AB and other project parties. Two calculation models have been developed within the project; one for calculating fuel needs (both HVO and hydrogen) and one for calculating TCO. It is largely through these models, as well as interviews, that practical and economic aspects have been analyzed. The project\u00b4s results have been disseminated in various forums and through the industry organization Sveriges \u00c5kerif\u00f6retag.The results indicate that it is practically and economically possible to switch from HVO to hydrogen in heavy transport tasks. The range of hydrogen trucks and the refueling stations planned are sufficient to carrying out transport tasks without noticeable routine changes. Drivers\u00b4 acceptance of hydrogen trucks is therefore high. From an economic perspective, the step is short to go from HVO to hydrogen with a maximum increase in Total Cost of Ownership of 10%. With a potentially reduced price of hydrogen, hydrogen driven transport is quickly becoming the cheaper option.",

It has explored data sharing for keyways and walkways, identified obstacles from imagery, and created a new machine-readable policy for delivery robots with geographic and operating time constraints. In addition, use cases for autonomous delivery robots were developed in suburbs to reduce traffic and increase efficiency, with great potential to reduce the number of delivery vehicles.The project has relied on several different methods and activities: exploratory development of relevant technology platforms, development of content and form for a digital policy, internal workshops as an arena to explore key issues, as well as public events engaging external stakeholders. Also research around the last kilometer and delivery robots case studies, as well as meetings with logistics companies to adjust the ideas has been important. Weekly internal meetings ensured coordination. These efforts helped the project achieve its objectiveThe result is a concept called \"Community Robots\u201d, which takes into account a lot of research on small vehicles and the last kilometer. It combines the logistical advantages of delivery cabinets with less land use and no passenger car journeys to the cabinets. About 20-30% of the cargo is bulky and is taken by vans, the rest by robots. The customer receives notification of packages in the area and can follow the robot\u00b4s position on the mobile.

The aim is to obtain knowledge about the effects of mobility solutions in new housing developments as quantifiable conclusions or percentages.The method is based on data collection from selected properties and surveys about the use and interest in mobility solutions. Collaboration with real estate developers makes the data collection possible. The survey can be conducted as a combination of postal and online survey. A quantitative analysis method will be applied to analyze the data and responses of the survey. The method will be analyzed to create an understanding of its potential for improvement. A car club will be implemented to enable comparison about travel habits and car ownership before and after implementation.Impact assessment of mobility solutions is necessary to understand how the solutions affect car ownership and travel habits. The method is expected to provide better data for adapting measures so that resources are invested in measures that have the greatest potential to contribute to increased sustainable travel. A reduction in car ownership is expected to contribute to an increase in the demand for car clubs, which can lead to fewer trips with private cars. Furthermore, a spread of results and knowledge about the effects of mobility solutions on car ownership is expected.",

At the end of the project, a prototype for current control will be developed, tested and validated in relevant AM equipment. The project will also offer a workshop to potential customers who will be given the opportunity to propose future applications where the developed solution can be tested in relevant demonstrators. A sustainability analysis is also planned.The use of additive manufacturing in the aerospace industry has already proven successful for load-bearing structures in titanium, but has been difficult to apply to nickel-base alloys due to their crack sensitivity. An introduction of a qualified AM system for nickel base alloys would lead to several improvements such as lighter, cheaper and more efficient aircraft engines, as well as lower environmental impact during an engine\u00b4s entire life cycle. More local production would also be possible as the need for large forgings would decrease, which today requires imports.",

            "Description": "This project aimed to initiate a core collaboration network for sustainable road materials in both research and higher education. This goal has been achieved with the completed project activities. Four focus themes were discussed during the project. A few areas of common interest were identified. The network\u2019s structure and working procedures were tested. Several future project and collaboration ideas were initiated.This project has been completed according to the project plan. Eight online meetings were held where various possibilities for future collaboration were discussed. A webinar was organised to gather relevant stakeholders from different Nordic countries, as well as to share and exchange knowledge and views on sustainable road infrastructure and to identify common research needs and boost international collaborations. More than 60 people from different countries participated in the webinar. Two physical visits were carried out during the project.With the successful implementation of this project, a core collaboration network has been initiated for increasing the collaboration in research and higher education and promoting innovations in sustainable road materials and road infrastructure. Continued work will enable the expansion of the network to a broader scope within sustainable road infrastructure, which will contribute to establishing a strategic international collaboration platform and support innovation exchange.",

            "Description": "The purpose of the CoMeBust-Me project is to create applicable products through a combination of academic research and industrial development that enable cost-effective conversion of onshore and marine internal combustion engines from fossil oil-based fuels to methanol.The concrete goal of the project is to develop, install and verify products that can cost-effectively replace fossil fuels with methanol in conventional diesel engines.The project will be carried out in a triple helix collaboration. Industrial research is led by ScandiNAOS. A diesel engine is adapted so that 50%-70% of the fuel can be replaced with methanol. The technology will be tested in actual operation in a pilot boat. Chalmers will research the opportunities to refine the dual fuel concept so that the proportion of diesel can be reduced. Another part concerns research on pre-chamber combustion with the goal that 100% of the diesel fuel can be replaced with methanol while maintaining the original engine efficiency.The goal of the \"Dual Fuel\" concept is that at least 50% of the diesel fuel can be replaced with methanol, the hope is that 70% replacement rate will be achieved.The goal of the pre-chamber concept is for the engine to be able to run on 100% methanol and meet today\u00b4s emission requirements without exhaust gas after treatment",
